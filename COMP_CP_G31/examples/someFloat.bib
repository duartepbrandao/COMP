                 the binary arithmetic that relay switches represented
                 would simplify information systems. His master's
                 thesis, written when he as twenty-one and published
                 when he was twenty-two, is considered to be one of the

                 Pages 59--61 of the thesis are a section called

                 68: ``As to the practicality of such a device, it might
                 be said that J. P. Kulik spent 20 years in constructing
                 a table of primes up to 100,000,000 and when finished
                 it was found to contain so many errors that it was not
                 worth publishing. The machine described here could
                 probably be made to handle 5 numbers per second so that
                 the table would require only about 2 months to

  abstract =     "It has been observed that the first pages of a table
                 of common logarithms show more wear than do the last
                 pages, indicating that more used numbers begin with the
                 digit 1 than with the digit 9. A compilation of some
                 20,000 first digits taken from widely divergent sources
                 shows that there is a logarithmic distribution of first
                 digits when the numbers are composed of four or more
                 digits. An analysis of the numbers from different
                 sources shows that the numbers taken from unrelated
                 subjects, such as a group of newspaper items, show a
                 much better agreement with a logarithmic distribution
                 than do numbers from mathematical tabulations or other
                 formal data. There is here the peculiar fact that
                 numbers that individually are without relationship are,
                 when considered in large groups, in good agreement with
                 a distribution law---hence the name ``Anomalous
                 Numbers.''\par

                 A further analysis of the data shows a strong tendency
                 for bodies of numerical data to fall into geometric
                 series. If the series is made up of numbers containing
                 three or more digits the first digits form a
                 logarithmic series. If the numbers contain only single
                 digits the geometric relation still holds but the
                 simple logarithmic relation no longer applies.\par

                 An equation is given showing the frequencies of first
                 digits in the different orders of numbers 1 to 10, 10
                 to 100, etc.\par

                 The equation also gives the frequency of digits in the
                 second, third + place of a multi-digit number, and it
                 is shown that the same law applies to
                 reciprocals.\par

                 There are many instances showing that the geometric
                 series, or the logarithmic law, has long been
                 recognized as a common phenomenon in factual literature
                 and in the ordinary affairs of life. The wire gauge and
                 drill gauge of the mechanic, the magnitude scale of the
                 astronomer and the sensory response curves of the
                 psychologist are all particular examples of a
                 relationship that seems to extend to all human affairs.
                 The Law of Anomalous Numbers is thus a general
                 probability law of widespread application.",

                 published in 1938 in a journal of rather limited
                 circulation and not usually read by mathematicians. It
                 so happened that it was immediately followed in the
                 same issue by a physics paper which became of some
                 importance for secret nuclear work during World War II
                 [H. A. Bethe, M. E. Rose, and L. P. Smith, `The
                 Multiple Scattering of Electrons', Proc. Amer. Phil.
                 Soc. 78(4), 573--585 (1938)]. That is why Benford's
                 paper caught the attention of physicists in the early
                 1940's and was much discussed. This led to the notes in
                 Nature by Goudsmit and Furry [3] and Furry and Hurwitz
                 [4] containing an effort to explain Benford's law. We
                 considered it at that time merely a welcome diversion
                 and did not expect that over thirty papers would be
                 devoted to this subject in subsequent years.'' The 2006
                 bibliography \cite{Hurlimann:2006:BLB} cites 325

                 http://www.lib.iastate.edu/arch/rgrp/5-2-1-1.html:

                 ``John Vincent Atanasoff received his M.S. (1926) in
                 Mathematics from Iowa State College (University) and
                 received his Ph.D. (1930) in Theoretical Physics from
                 the University of Wisconsin-Madison. He returned to
                 Iowa State in 1930 as Assistant Professor in
                 mathematics and physics and was promoted to Associate
                 Professor (1936). Atanasoff began developing concepts
                 for an electronic computing machine in 1937. It was
                 shortly thereafter that he, along with graduate student
                 Clifford Berry, started work on the world's first
                 electronic digital computer. The computer would later
                 be named the Atanasoff-Berry Computer (ABC).

                 Work on the machine stopped at the start of World War
                 II in 1941 and the ABC was never patented. Atanasoff
                 and Berry were both called to support the war effort
                 and left Iowa State. By the end of the decade, the ABC
                 was removed from the basement of Physics Hall and
                 dismantled.

                 Atanasoff and the ABC were part of a major court case
                 between Honeywell, Inc. and Sperry Rand Corporation
                 which occurred 1967-1973. The case involved the ENIAC
                 patent which covered basic ownership rights to the
                 design of electronic digital computers. During the
                 trial, the judge concluded that the invention of the
                 ENIAC was derived from the work of John Vincent
                 Atanasoff at Iowa State University.

                 A replica of the Atanasoff-Berry Computer was completed
                 and unveiled to the public in 1996. The ABC replica was
                 constructed by a team of Iowa State scientists at the
                 Ames Laboratory and was exhibited at museums throughout
                 the country over the next several years.''",
  remark =       "This thesis may be one of the earliest surviving
                 records of the ABC computer built by John Atanasoff and
                 Clifford Berry in the late 1930s. The one-of-a-kind ABC
                 was destroyed in 1948, and most of its parts were lost.

                 the group retained by Honeywell in the Honeywell v.

                 computation, and concludes that floating-point is
                 probably not justifiable. They wrote:\par

                 ``There appear to be two major purposes in a `floating'
                 decimal point system both of which arise from the fact
                 that the number of digits in a word is a constant fixed
                 by design considerations for each particular machine.
                 The first of these purposes is to retain in a sum or
                 product as many significant digits as possible and the
                 second of these is to free the human operator from the
                 burden of estimating and inserting into a problem
                 `scale factors' --- multiplicative constants which
                 serve to keep numbers within the limits of the
                 machine.\par

                 There is, of course, no denying the fact that human
                 time is consumed in arranging for the introduction of
                 suitable scale factors. We only argue that the time so
                 consumed is a very small percentage of the total time
                 we will spend in preparing an interesting problem for
                 our machine. The first advantage of the floating point
                 is, we feel, somewhat illusory. In order to have such a
                 floating point, one must waste memory capacity which
                 could otherwise be used for carrying more digits per
                 word. It would therefore seem to us not at all clear
                 whether the modest advantages of a floating binary
                 point offset the loss of memory capacity and the
                 increased complexity of the arithmetic and control
                 circuits.''",

                 operating in floating point, this Speedcoding
                 calculator has extremely convenient means for getting
                 information into the machine and for printing results;
                 it has an extensive set of operations to make the job
                 of programming as easy as possible. Speedcoding also
                 provides automatic address modification, flexible
                 tracing, convenient use of auxiliary storage, and
                 built-in checking.",

  abstract =     "One of the primary functions of the MIDAC installation
                 at the University of Michigan is the instruction of
                 beginners in the various aspects of digital machine use
                 including programming and coding. \ldots{} In
                 conducting these courses it was soon found to be
                 extremely difficult, in five or six instruction
                 periods, to bring a complete newcomer up to the point
                 where he can code and check out on MIDAC anything more
                 than a rather trivial routine. As might be expected the
                 difficulty centers around problems of scaling,
                 instruction modification and binary representation.
                 \ldots{} To alleviate these problems it was decided
                 that a new computer was needed: one designed to make
                 programming easier. At the cost of some of MIDAC's
                 speed and capacity plus two or three man-months of
                 programming time EASIAC, the EASy Instruction Automatic
                 Computer, was realized as a translation-interpretation
                 program in MIDAC.",

  abstract =     "An experimental 50-megacycle arithmetic unit has been
                 built which performs a repetitive multiplication
                 program and checks the results for errors. The unit
                 uses pulse circuitry which has been developed to
                 perform digital operations at a 50-megacycle
                 pulse-repetition rate. This paper describes the
                 arithmetic system and the circuits which perform the
                 required functions. These circuits include a full
                 binary adder, a phase-locked frequency divider which
                 provides a 3.125-megacycle secondary timing source, a
                 reshaping and retiming circuit using germanium diodes
                 and capacitive storage, a high-speed shift register, a
                 high-speed indicator register, and a binary word
                 generator.\par

                 Various novel features of a digital system operating at
                 these high speeds are described. These include the use
                 of coaxial delay lines for the distribution of signals
                 and as storage elements, and the use of secondary
                 emission tubes in amplifier and multivibrator
                 circuits.\par

                 In a 50-megacycle system the interdependence of the
                 space and time dimensions is marked, and although this
                 introduces problems which are not ordinarily
                 encountered in computing systems, it may be used
                 advantageously to provide features such as the
                 variable-phase clock system used in the arithmetic
                 unit.\par

                 The performance and reliability of the arithmetic unit
                 are discussed as well as the reliability of the
                 components and circuits which make up the system.
                 Although the techniques and circuitry discussed here
                 have been applied only to a relatively simple
                 arithmetic unit, it is felt that they could be useful
                 in a variety of high-speed computing and measurements
                 applications.",

                 application of the residue number system for
                 computation is presented. Areas of investigation
                 include sampling, analog-to-residue conversion, logical
                 design of the arithmetic units, residue-to-analog
                 conversion, and modes of operation of the proposed
                 digital correlator. The advantages of speed of
                 computation and simplicity of logic due to the use of a
                 residue number system are shown to result in a
                 significantly faster and simpler system than if a
                 conventional number system were used. The resulting
                 digital correlator is designed for megacycle sampling
                 and computation with a 0.1 per cent system precision.",

                 contract was to investigate the feasibility of residue
                 number systems in their applications to digital
                 computers. The problems of such an application are the
                 ones of magnitude determination, sign determination,
                 overflow, scaling, and division. These problems are not
                 independent, but are found to be quite interrelated. A
                 theoretical treatment of residue number systems is
                 given which lays the foundation for a unified study of
                 the complete problem. Treatments of an organizational
                 nature are given which deal with multiplication,
                 division, and scaling. The matter of correlating the
                 theoretical and organizational studies to physical
                 realizations involving networks is treated also. The
                 question of whether the residue number system can be
                 successfully applied to general purpose computers is
                 still an open one. Their application to special purpose
                 machines is considered both feasible and practical.",

  abstract =     "It has been noticed by astute observers that well used
                 tables of logarithms are invariably dirtier at the
                 front than at the back. Upon reflection one is led to
                 inquire whether there are more physical constants with
                 low order first significant digits than high. Actual
                 counts by Benford [2] show that not only is this the
                 case but that it seems to be an empirical truth that
                 whenever one has a large body of physical data,
                 Farmer's Almanac, Census Reports, Chemical Rubber
                 Handbook, etc., the proportion of these data with first
                 significant digit $n$ or less is approximately $
                 \log_{10}(n + 1) $. Any reader formerly unaware of this
                 ``peculiarity'' will find an actual sampling experiment
                 wondrously tantalizing. Thus, for example,
                 approximately $ 0.7 $ of the physical constants in the
                 Chemical Rubber Handbook begin with $4$ or less ($
                 \log_{10}(4 + 1) = 0.699 $ ). This is to be contrasted
                 with the widespread intuitive evaluation $ 4 / 9 $
                 ths.",

                 approximately $ \log_{10}(n + 1) $.''\par

                 \ldots{} ``The only distribution for first significant
                 digits which is invariant under scale change of the
                 underlying distribution is $ \log_{10}(n + 1) $.
                 Contrary to suspicion this is a non-trivial
                 mathematical result, for the variable $n$ is
                 discrete.''.\par

                 From p. 1230: ``The foregoing results bear on questions
                 of round-off in computing machines. Since $ d(u v) = u
                 d v + v d u $, the error resulting from multiplying two
                 rounded numbers will be governed primarily by the first
                 significant digits of the two numbers being multiplied.
                 Now the distribution of first significant digits,
                 favoring as it does low order digits, tends to produce
                 less error than would be the case if first significant
                 digits were uniform as has sometimes been

                 See \cite{MacKenzie:1991:IAL} for a remark about the
                 noisy mode for floating-point arithmetic in the IBM
                 7030 Stretch. That mode is first mentioned on page 25
                 of this book, and described in detail on page 102,
                 which states:

                 ``By definition of ordinary normalized FLP operations,
                 numbers are frequently extended on the right by
                 attaching zeros. During addition the n-digit operand
                 that is not preshifted is extended with n zeros, so as
                 to provide the extra positions to which the preshifted
                 operand can be added. Any operand or result that is
                 shifted left to be normalized requires a corresponding
                 number of zeros to be shifted in at the right. Both
                 sets of zeros tend to produce numbers smaller in
                 absolute value than they would have been if more digits
                 had been carried. In the noisy mode these numbers are
                 simply extended with 1 s instead of zeros (1 s in a
                 binary machine, 9s in a decimal machine). So all
                 numbers tend to be too large in absolute value. The
                 true value, if there had been no significance loss,
                 should lie between these two extremes. Hence, two runs,
                 one made without and one made with the noisy mode,
                 should show differences in result that indicate which
                 digits may have been affected by significance loss.

                 The principal weakness of the noisy-mode procedure is
                 that it requires two runs for the same problem. A much
                 less important weakness is that the loss of
                 significance cannot be guaranteed to show up --- it
                 merely has a very high probability of showing up ---
                 whereas built-in significance checks can be made
                 slightly pessimistic, so that actual significance loss
                 will not be greater than indicated. On the other hand,
                 little extra hardware and no extra storage are required
                 for the noisy-mode approach. Furthermore, significance
                 loss is relatively rare, so that running a problem
                 twice when Significance loss is suspected does not pose
                 a serious problem. What is serious is the possibility
                 of unsuspected significance loss.

                 In discussions of significance two points are often
                 overlooked. The first of these is trivial: the best way
                 of ensuring significant results is to use an adequate
                 number of fraction digits. The second is almost equally
                 mundane: for a given procedure, normalized FLP
                 arithmetic will ordinarily produce the greatest
                 precision possible for the number of fraction digits
                 used. Normalized FLP arithmetic has been criticized
                 with respect to significance loss, because such loss is
                 not indicated by the creation of leading zeros, as it
                 is with fixed-point arithmetic. In other words, the
                 contention is not that normalized FLP arithmetic is
                 more prone to significance loss than equivalent
                 fixed-point arithmetic, which would be untrue, but that
                 an equivalent indication of such loss is not provided.
                 Loss of significance, however, is also a serious
                 problem in fixed-point arithmetic; multiplication and
                 division do not handle it at all correctly by means of
                 leading zeros. (In particular, fixed-point
                 multiplication may lead to serious or even total
                 significance loss, which would not have occurred with
                 normalized FLP arithmetic: and although leading zeros
                 in addition and subtraction of fixed-point operands do
                 give correct significance indications, the use of other
                 operations and of built-in scaling loops frequently
                 destroys entirely the leading-zeros method of counting
                 significance.)''",

                 for two types of numbers, real and integer, which are
                 usually implemented on the computer by means of
                 floating-point and fixed-point numbers respectively.
                 The concepts real and integer, however, are taken from
                 mathematics, where the set of integers forms a proper
                 subset of the set of real numbers. In implementation a
                 real problem is posed by the fact that the set of
                 fixed-point numbers is not a proper subset of the set
                 of floating-point numbers; this problem becomes very
                 apparent in attempts to implement ALGOL 60.
                 Furthermore, the {\em one\/} mathematical operation of
                 addition is implemented in the machine by one of {\em
                 two\/} machine operations, fixed-point addition or
                 floating-point addition.",

  abstract =     "In January of 1960, the late Hans J. Maehly completed
                 a summary of approximations to the elementary functions
                 for the CDC-1604 computer. The approximations and
                 techniques suggested by Maehly are equally applicable
                 to the second large computer in the CDC line, the 3600.
                 Unlike the 1604, however, the 3600 has built-in
                 double-precision floating-point arithmetic. The present
                 work, largely inspired by the successes of Maehly and
                 his associates, concerns the extension of one of
                 Maehly's ideas to a double-precision subroutine for the
                 3600.",

                 likely to be a 0 or a 1, then their analysis shows that

                 However, they report that a more likely distribution is
                 logarithmic (as predicted by Benford's Law, although
                 the Newcomb / Benford work is neither mentioned nor

                 for variable precision division in digital computers.
                 Unlike the earlier methods of Stein and Pope, the
                 present method uses a suitably rounded form of the
                 normalized divisor for getting an estimate of the
                 quotient characters. This result is a correction of at
                 most plus or minus one to the estimate, to obtain the
                 exact quotient character. It is believed that this
                 method will be widely applicable for division
                 operations in variable word-length character-oriented
                 machines.",

                 analysis have made feasible the use of variable
                 precision arithmetic and the preparation of programs
                 that automatically determine their own precision
                 requirements. Such programs enable the user to specify
                 the accuracy he wants, and yield answers guaranteed to
                 lie within the bounds prescribed. A class of such
                 programs, called ``contracting error programs'', is
                 defined in which the precision is determined by
                 prescribing error bounds on the data. A variant of
                 interval arithmetic is defined which enables a limited
                 class of algorithms to be programmed as contracting
                 error programs. A contracting error program for the
                 solution of simultaneous linear equations is described,
                 demonstrating the application of the idea to a wider
                 class of problems.",

                 that the accumulated effect of roundoff errors is in
                 some sense statistical. The purpose of this paper is to
                 give precise descriptions of certain probabilistic
                 models for roundoff error, and then to describe a
                 series of experiments for testing the validity of these
                 models. It is concluded that the models are in general
                 very good. Discrepancies are both rare and mild. The
                 test techniques can also be used to experiment with
                 various types of special arithmetic.",

                 generally difficult to know just when to accept a
                 number as an adequate approximation to the root. In
                 this paper an algorithm is presented which allows one
                 to terminate the iteration process on the basis of
                 calculated bounds for the roundoff error which occurs
                 in evaluating the polynomial. This stopping criterion
                 has been tested on numerous examples and has been found
                 to serve as a satisfactory means for accepting a
                 complex number as a zero of a real polynomial.",

  abstract =     "The use of a parallel multiplier for performing
                 high-speed binary division requires that an algorithm
                 be devised that obtains the quotient by means of
                 multiplications and additions. Furthermore, its
                 hardware implementation must be as simple and as fast
                 as possible. A suitable algorithm, which applies to a
                 first approximation to the reciprocal of the divisor,
                 has already been proposed [1]. A similar algorithm is
                 presented in this paper. The comparison between the two
                 methods for equal numbers of multiplications shows that
                 the latter is more accurate. Conversely, a given
                 accuracy can often be obtained with a higher speed. The
                 generation of a piecewise-linear initial approximation
                 is also discussed.",

                 floating-point numbers accurately by 27-bit [binary]
                 floating-point numbers. However, we need 28 significant

                 general, we can show that if $ 10^p < 2^{q - 1} $, then
                 $q$ significant bits are always enough for $p$-digit
                 decimal accuracy. Finally, we can define a compact
                 27-bit floating-point representation that will give 28
                 significant bits, for numbers of practical

                 taken as a fraction of their sum, the rounded
                 percentages often fail to add to 100 percent. We
                 investigate how frequently this failure occurs and what
                 the distributions of sums of rounded percentages are
                 for (1) an empirical set of data, (2) the multinomial

                 The several methods produce similar distributions.We
                 find that the probability that the sum of rounded
                 percentages adds to exactly 100 percent is certain for
                 two categories, about three-fourths for three

  abstract =     "In this paper, several results are presented
                 concerning the effects of roundoff in the
                 floating-point realization of a general discrete filter
                 governed ideally by a stable difference equation of the
                 form\par

                  $$ w_n = \sum_{k = 0}^M b_k x_{n - k} - \sum {k = 1}^N
                 a_k w_{n - k}, \qquad n \geq N \qquad (1) $$ \par

                 in which $ \{ w_n \} $ and $ \{ x_n \} $ are output and
                 input sequences, respectively.\par

                 In particular, for a large class of filters it is
                 proved that there is a function $ f(K) $ with $ f(K)
                 \to 0 $ as $ K \to \infty $ and a constant $c$, both
                 dependent on the $ b_k $, the $ a_k $, the order in
                 which the products on the right side of (1) are summed
                 in the machine, and $t$, the number of bits allotted to
                 the mantissa, such that\par

                  $$ \langle e \rangle_K \leq c \langle y \rangle_K +
                 f(K) $$ \par

                 for all $ K \geq N $, in which, with the computed
                 output sequence of the realized filter,\par

                  $$ \langle y \rangle_K = \left (\frac {1}{K + 1}
                 \sum_{n = 0}^K |y_n|^2 \right)^{1 / 2} $$ \par

                 and\par

                  $$ \langle e \rangle_K = \left (\frac {1}{K + 1}
                 \sum_{n = 0}^K |w_n - y_n|^2 \right)^{1 / 2} $$
                 \par

                 Bounds on $ f(K) $ and $c$ are given that are not
                 difficult to evaluate, and which, in many realistic
                 cases, are informative. For example, for the
                 second-order bandpass filter:\par

                  $$ w_n = x_n - a_1 w_{n - 1} - a_2 w_{n - 2}, \qquad n
                 \geq 2 \qquad (2) $$ \par

                 with $ a_1 $ and $ a_2 $ chosen so that its poles arc
                 at approximately $ \pm 45^\circ $ and at distance
                 approximately (but not less than) $ 0.001 $ from the
                 unit circle, we find that $c$, an upper bound on the
                 ``asymptotic output error-to-signal ratio'', is not
                 greater than $ 0.58 \times 10^{-4} $, assuming that $ t
                 = 27 $, that the terms on the right side of (2) are
                 summed in the machine in the order indicated (from
                 right to left), and that the $ x_n $ in (2) are machine
                 numbers. If the $ x_n $ are not machine numbers, and
                 hence must be quantized before processing, then $ c
                 \leq 0.76 \times 10^{-4} $.\par

                 In addition to error bounds, an inequality is derived
                 which, if satisfied, rules out certain types of
                 generally undesirable behavior such as self-sustained
                 output limit cycles due to roundoff effects. This
                 inequality is satisfied for the example described
                 above.",

                 in connection with university projects sponsored by
                 government military and research organizations. Many
                 established companies, as well as new companies,
                 entered the computer field during the first generation,
                 1947-1959, in which the vacuum tube was almost
                 universally used as the active component in the
                 implementation of computer logic. The second generation
                 was characterized by the transistorized computers that
                 began to appear in 1959. Some of the computers built
                 then and since are considered super computers; they
                 attempt to go to the limit of current technology in
                 terms of size, speed, and logical complexity. From 1965
                 onward, most new computers belong to a third
                 generation, which features integrated circuit
                 technology and multiprocessor multiprogramming
                 systems.",

  abstract =     "In keeping with the experimental nature of the
                 Illinois Pattern Recognition Computer (ILLIAC III), the
                 arithmetic units are intended to be a practical testing
                 ground for recent theoretical work in computer
                 arithmetic. This paper describes the use of redundant
                 number systems and the design of a structure with which
                 multiplication and division are executed radix 256. The
                 heart of the unit is the stored-sign subtracter, a
                 recently discovered member of the family of borrow-save
                 subtracters and carry-save adders. A cascade of these
                 subtracters, controlled by a multiplier recoder,
                 provides multiplication. The same structure, controlled
                 by a ``model division'' (a quotient recoder), performs
                 division.",

                 the machine clearly show an IBM System/360-style
                 base-16 encoding. This paper reveals the source of the
                 confusion: the multiplier uses a Wallace recoding
                 scheme, first defined for radix 4, but extended for the
                 ILLIAC III to radix 256. Thus, multiplication is done 8
                 bits at a time. Division is done 4 bits at a time.",

  abstract =     "The advent of large-scale integration of logic
                 circuits requires the definition of digital computer
                 structure in terms of large functional arrays of logic
                 of very few types. This paper describes a
                 single-package arithmetic processor called the
                 arithmetic building element (ABE). The ABE accepts
                 operands in either conventional or signed-digit radix-r
                 representation and produces signed-digit results, which
                 the ABE can reconvert to conventional form. Radix 16 is
                 chosen for illustrations. Arrays of ABE's may be
                 arranged to implement unit-time parallel addition,
                 all-combinational multiplication, and more complex
                 functions which are presently computed by subroutines.
                 To facilitate such arithmetic design, a graph model is
                 developed which permits a translation of the given
                 arithmetical algorithm into an interconnection diagram
                 of ABE's. The design procedure is illustrated by an
                 array for polynomial evaluation. Speed, cost, and
                 roundoff error of the array are considered. A computer
                 program has been written for the automatic translation
                 of the algorithm graph to an interconnection graph, and
                 for the evaluation of the cost and speed for a given
                 polynomial degree and a given precision requirement.",

                 a floating-point format is formalized as a mapping of
                 the reals into a specified subset of real numbers. The
                 structure of this subset, the set of $n$ significant
                 digit base $b$ floating-point numbers, is analyzed and

                 division to the theory of multiplier recoding. Since
                 each binary quotient digit has three possible values,
                 the quotient resulting from the SRT division is in
                 recoded form; in this paper it is shown that the
                 recoding is a function of the divisor, and the method
                 for determining the characteristic Boolean function of
                 the recoding is presented. The relationship between the
                 division and the recoding is established by scaling the
                 division in such a way that the scaled ``visor''

  abstract =     "An adder is described for addition of a large number
                 of binary numbers $ x_j, j = 1, 2, \ldots {}, m $,
                 where $ x_j = \sum_i x_{j, i} 2^i, x_{j, i} = 0, 1, i =
                 0, 1, \ldots {}, n - 1 $. The adder's algorithm has two
                 parts: (1) the bits $ x_{j, i} $ are added
                 independently for each binary order $ i : s_i = \sum_j
                 x_{j, i} \leq m $ and the result expressed in the
                 binary form $ s_i = \sum_k a_{i, k} 2^k, a_{i, k} = 0,
                 1, k = 0, 1, \ldots {}, p - 1 $ (where $ 2^{p - 1} \leq
                 m < 2^p $ ); (2) the sum $ y = \sum_j x_j $ is formed
                 by adding terms $ s_{i, k} {2^{i + k}} $ as
                 contributions of the bit $ s_{i, k} $ to the total $y$.
                 A hardware implementation of this algorithm is
                 suggested where the sum $ s_i $ is obtained by a
                 sequential circuit which reorders the values $ x_{j,
                 i}' $ so that their sum $ s_i $, remains unchanged and
                 so that after the reordering the new values $ x_{j, i}'
                 $ obey the conditions $ x_{j + 1, i} \leq x_{j, i} $
                 for every $ j = 1, 2, \ldots {}, m - 1 $. The
                 implementation with integrated circuits should be quite
                 rewarding because the control of the circuit is done
                 with independent control elements distributed all over
                 the chip.",

  abstract =     "The computer is a small desk-top machine designed for
                 teaching schoolchildren how computers work. It works in
                 decimal notation and has a powerful instruction set
                 which includes 3-address floating-point instructions
                 implemented as `extracode' subroutines. Addressing can
                 be absolute, relative or indirect. For input it uses a
                 capacitive touch keyboard, and for output and display a
                 perfectly normal TV receiver is used. Another
                 input/output device is an ordinary domestic tape
                 recorder, used mainly for long term storage of
                 programs. To make the operation of the machine easy to
                 follow, it can be made to stop at certain stages in the
                 processing of an instruction and automaticaly display
                 the contents of all registers and storage locations
                 relevant at that time. The paper gives a description of
                 the machine and a discussion of the factors that hav
                 influenced its design.",

                 scale integration, a unique microelectronic arithmetic
                 building element and combinational arithmetic nets,
                 composed of the building elements, have been studied
                 and proposed for arithmetic processor design. A fast

                 signed-digit arithmetic. This algorithm is
                 characterized by the need of preprocessing the divisor
                 and then exact generation of quotient digits. This
                 paper describes the implementation of this division
                 algorithm with the arithmetic building element and
                 combinational arithmetic nets. The intention here is to

                 exponential, logarithm, quotient, and square root with
                 a minimum use of multiplications or divisions.
                 Basically, use is made of the fact that $ x(1 \pm
                 2^{-m}) $ can be evaluated by a shift followed by an
                 add. A pair of numbers $ (x_k, y_k) $ can represent a
                 function $ x : f(x) = g(x_k, y_k) $, such that $ g(l,
                 y_n) = y_n $ for logarithm, quotient and square root.
                 Then, multiplication by shifting is applied to $ x_k $
                 with suitable adjustments on $ y_k $, until $ x_k $ is
                 close to unity, at which time $ y_k $ represents the
                 desired answer. The exponential is computed by
                 essentially reversing the logarithm procedure. A
                 termination algorithm further improves accuracy. The
                 apparatus involves two registers for $ x_k $ and $ y_k
                 $, a local memory, an adder and a shift register.",

  abstract =     "The present paper is intended to give an axiomatic
                 approach to rounded computations. A rounding is defined
                 as a monotone mapping of an ordered set into a subset,
                 which in general is called a lower respectively an
                 upper screen. The first chapter deals with roundings in
                 ordered sets. In the second chapter further properties
                 of roundings in linearly ordered sets are studied. The
                 third chapter deals with the two most important
                 applications, the approximation of the real arithmetic
                 on a finite screen and the approximation of the real
                 interval arithmetic on an upper screen. Beyond these
                 examples various further applications are possible.",

  abstract =     "The general study of the conversion of a number from
                 the radix p to the radix q number system leads to four
                 different algorithms for integers, and to four similar
                 ones for fractions. Most transform algorithms can be
                 implemented by iterative arrays of cells characterized
                 by simple equations. Such arrays are very attractive
                 with present-time large-scale integration technology.
                 Two kinds of cells, that is, two iterative arrays, are
                 sufficient for the near instantaneous conversion of
                 fixed-point numbers from radix p to radix q, or vice
                 versa. For the important special case of binary-decimal
                 conversion, the structure of the cells is studied, and
                 different realizations using the BCD code are
                 described. One of them is specially suited for an LSI
                 realization in MOS technology. The advantages of other
                 codes are discussed. In particular, the use of the
                 biquinary code allows the realization of the fastest
                 cells, with only one gate delay for each line of
                 cells.",

                 using residue adders only; we show that relatively
                 simple combinational logic can be used to replace one
                 level of residue addition. In the reverse translation
                 problem, we examine the conditions under which base
                 extension can be used to compute the fixed-base digits
                 from a residue code number, and we study the efficiency
                 of the algorithm.",

                 roots for fraction arguments, employing only shifts,
                 adds, high-speed table lookups, and bit counting. The
                 scheme is based on the cotransformation of a number
                 pair $ (x, y) $ such that the $ F(x, y) = f(x_0) $ is
                 invariant; when $x$ is driven towards a known value $
                 x_w $, $y$ is driven towards the result. For an $N$-bit
                 fraction about $ N / 4 $ iterations are required, each
                 involving two or three adds; then a termination
                 algorithm, based on an add and an abbreviated multiply,
                 completes the process, for a total cost of about one

                 functions of rational arguments also have simple
                 continued fractions, but these are generally not
                 regular and cannot be reconstructed from numerical
                 values by a simple algorithm, since nonregular
                 representations aren't unique. The point is, however,
                 that numbers like e, pi, sqrt(2), sin .5, sqrt(7)
                 arctan sqrt(7), etc. can be expressed to unlimited
                 precision by simple programs which produce the terms on
                 demand.'' Also: ``Rational number arithmetic often
                 loses because numerators and denominators grow so large
                 as to require icky multiprecision. Algorithms for
                 arithmetic on continued fractions seem generally
                 unknown. The next items describe how to arithmetically
                 combine continued fractions to produce new ones, one
                 term at a time.'' and ``Continued fractions let us
                 perform numerical calculations a little at a time
                 without ever introducing any error, such as roundoff or
                 truncation. As if this weren't enough, the calculations
                 provide automatic error analysis, and obviate most
                 forms of successive approximation.''",

                 proposed for use in programming languages and in
                 digital computers. Special symbols are proposed for
                 numbers too large, too small or too close to zero to be
                 represented in the normal digital number system, or
                 which are undefined. Properties of mappings among and
                 between digital number systems are used to justify the
                 augments chosen. Finally a suggestion is made for a new
                 floating point word format that will serve all the
                 above needs and will greatly extend the exponent range

                 tend to be dirtier at the beginning than at the end.
                 This indicated to Benford that people had more occasion
                 to calculate with numbers beginning with 1 or 2 than
                 with 8 or 9.\par

                 Benford also found that the frequency of the digit p
                 being the first digit of a decimal number was very
                 closely approximated by $ \log (p + 1) - \log p $
                 [i.e., $ \log (1 + 1 / p) $ ]. This has become known as
                 Benford's law.",

                 The arithmetic systems studied are 6-digit hexadecimal

                 representations combined with the usual chop and round

  remark =       "From p. 116: ``There is general agreement that the
                 mantissas of floating-point numbers are not uniformly
                 distributed. [See Hamming (1962)
                 [\cite{Hamming:1962:NMS}], Pinkham (1961)
                 [Pinkham:1961:DFS], or Knuth (1969) [Knuth:1969:SNM].]
                 Instead, it is customary to assume that they are
                 distributed logarithmically, that is, that the
                 probability density function is

                  $$ (3.12.9) f(m) = \frac {1}{m \ln r}, \qquad r^{-1}
                 \leq m \leq 1. $$

                 This assumption is based on the following observations:
                 First, this distribution reproduces itself under
                 multiplication, but a uniform distribution does not.
                 [See Hamming (1962) [\cite{Hamming:1962:NMS}] and
                 Exercise 20.] A second justification is based on the
                 fact that many of the numbers that arise in computation
                 represent measurable quantities such as lengths,
                 forces, etc., and it is reasonable to believe that the
                 distribution of the mantissas of such quantities is
                 independent of the units in which they are measured.
                 Pinkham (1961) shows that this leads to the conclusion
                 that the distribution of mantissas must be
                 logarithmic.''",

  abstract =     "Array-like structures for high-speed multiplication,
                 division, square and square-root operations have been
                 described in this paper. In these designs the division
                 and square-rooting time have been made to approach to
                 that of multiplication operation. These structures are
                 optimum from speed and versatility point of view. Most
                 of the cellular arrays described in the literature are
                 adequately slow. The time delay is particularly
                 significant in the division and square-rooting
                 operations due to the ripple effect of the carries.
                 Though the carry-save technique has been widely
                 utilized for multiplication operation, it has been only
                 recently employed by Cappa et al. in the design of a
                 nonrestoring divider array. This requires sign-bit
                 detection that makes the array non-uniform. Such an
                 array has been named as an array-like structure. The
                 carry-save method has been extended here for restoring
                 division operation. Due to sign-detection and overflow
                 correction requirements, the restoring method is
                 slightly complex. But the main advantage of such
                 restoring array is in its simple extension for
                 multiplication operation. The array for the two
                 operations, when pipelined, will have more computing
                 power than all other multiplier-divider arrays.
                 Suggestions have also been included for further speed
                 improvement.\par

                 The technique applied for division operation is as well
                 applicable for the square-rooting and an array-like
                 structure for square-square-rooting operations has also
                 been given. For performing any one of the four
                 operations, the only manipulation to be done is to
                 combine the two arrays; one for multiplication-division
                 and another for square-square-rooting. Possible.
                 methods of combining the two arrays have been indicated
                 and their relative advantages and disadvantages have
                 been mentioned. Finally, a generalized pipeline
                 array-like structure with complete internal details and
                 for 4-bit operation, has been shown. Due consideration
                 has also been given to the possibility of
                 large-scale-integration of different arrays presented
                 in this paper.",

                 systems. The method utilizes a systematic decomposition
                 of the sign function $S$ that is based on some special
                 properties of $S$. Starting with the canonical
                 sum-of-products expression for $S$, we transform the
                 expression to a form whose realization is simpler than
                 the canonical form realization and, if possible, also
                 simpler than the minimal sum-of-products realization.
                 In some cases, the proposed method yields savings as
                 high as 85\% compared to the minimal sum-of-products
                 realization for $S$.",

                 conversions by the expansion of the original BIDEC
                 method (Ref. 1). There are quite a few static
                 conversion schemes published which use other methods of
                 conversion. The static method, developed from the
                 BIDEC, lends itself best for the expansion to larger
                 structures as in its original ``correct and shift''
                 form there were no basic limitations on the size of the
                 binary words to be converted. with the appearance of
                 large bipolar ROMs and the even larger but somewhat
                 slower MOS ROMs there is a renewed interest in large

  abstract =     "Recently, while considering the connection of a 48 bit
                 word computer to a 16 bit computer, we felt the need
                 for a fast and inexpensive device that would multiply a
                 binary address by a factor of three. Since $ 3 N = N +
                 2 N $, there is an obvious solution of providing a
                 normal adder circuit and presenting one set of inputs
                 with $N$ and the other with $N$-shifted left one place.
                 But, there is a great deal of redundancy here since
                 knowing one input we have complete knowledge of the
                 other.\par

                 Seeking to take advantage of this redundancy, we have
                 spent some twenty man hours and have saved one gate per
                 stage over a conventional full adder. Since the
                 ultimate circuit is to be a ``one-of'' this is scarcely
                 economic, but it has been fun. Before going further,
                 the interested reader may enjoy puzzling over the
                 problem for himself. We make no pretense of minimality,
                 but we have a circuit with 6 gates per stage and a
                 propagation delay of one gate per stage.",

                 of non-standard arithmetics, as well as
                 standard.\par

                 The implementation of a system is described where
                 syntactic extensions to a language are made to support
                 a microprogrammed virtual arithmetic unit which can
                 treat variants such as integers, normalized, and
                 unnormalized floating point numbers and intervals,
                 within a unified representation.\par

                 More specifically Pascal is chosen as the base
                 language, because it allows the user to define new data
                 types, and the extension then mainly consists in
                 substituting the simple (unstructured) data type {\em
                 real\/} with a skeletal structured type (which will be
                 called {\em numeric\/}).\par

                 The system is intended to be implemented on a
                 microprogrammable processor (called MATHILDA) with a 64
                 bit wide datapath. The language Pascal has already been
                 partially implemented based on a stack machine
                 specifically designed for that language, and realized
                 by interpretation in microcode. The present compiler
                 was constructed with the aid of a parser-generator
                 system, which will allow the language extensions to be
                 made with a moderate effort.",

                 mathematical foundation of computer arithmetic have
                 been written. Some of these papers are still
                 unpublished. The papers consider the spaces which occur

                 a properly defined computer arithmetic. The following
                 treatment gives a summary of the main ideas of these
                 papers. Many of the proofs had to be sketched or
                 completely omitted. In such cases the full information

                 arithmetic units which can execute nonstandard integer
                 and floating-point arithmetic. An arithmetic unit is
                 proposed whose characteristics are based on user
                 specifications and subsequently is termed a Polymorphic
                 Arithmetic Unit (PAU). The user binds the identity of
                 the PAU by specifying the contents of various
                 descriptors and semantic interpretation tables which
                 the PAU accesses during its execution. This capability
                 removes several of the restrictions found in
                 commercially available arithmetic units and potentially
                 assists in making mathematically software portable.",

  abstract =     "Random number generators can be programmed in FORTRAN
                 using several methods on 1's complement machines. We
                 have presented several methods for the SRU 1107--1108
                 and CDC 6000 and CYBER series, the two most popular
                 that utilize 1's complement arithmetic. We believe the
                 logical mask method to be the most efficient technique
                 based on execution time on both machines. This method
                 requires only a little more than one-half the time of
                 the signed residue method on the SRU 1107--1108 and a
                 little more than two thirds the time of the unsigned
                 residue method on the CDC 6000--CYBER. A fast composite
                 generator in FORTRAN uses the logical mask method
                 combined with the FLD function to implement the table
                 approach of MacLaren and Marsaglia (1965). This
                 generator proves to be more than twice as fast as a
                 previous one for the SRU 1108, Marsaglia and Bray

                 standard data type {\em real\/} of the language Pascal
                 with a unified data representation termed {\em
                 numeric}. The {\em numeric\/} data type can represent a
                 variety of arithmetic operands such as integers,
                 normalized floating point numbers, and centered-radius
                 intervals.\par

                 This paper describes an arithmetic unit which is
                 capable of executing the standard arithmetic operations
                 (addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division)
                 on pairs of operands specified to be of the {\em
                 numeric\/} data type. This arithmetic unit, called the
                 UNRAU --- Unified Numeric Representation Arithmetic
                 Unit, supports operations on operands externally
                 represented as 5-tuples $ (t, a, e, f, r) $. The UNRAU
                 provides for automatic conversion among the various
                 data types and can also be used to perform an explicit
                 conversion on a single operand.\par

                 It is intended to implement the UNRAU on a dynamically
                 microprogrammable microprocessor to determine what host
                 facilities are required to efficiently realize such an
                 arithmetic unit and to experiment with the high level
                 language support of such a unit.",

                 which are very fast and capable of processing large
                 amounts of data. Some advances in scientific processing
                 have been slowed due to the lack of supercomputer
                 capabilities which are required primarily in the area
                 of Central Processor speed and the availability of
                 large amounts of high speed memory. Particularly in the
                 fields of modeling and simulation, additional speed and
                 memory capacity are desired to allow increased
                 resolution of the experiment. Technological
                 developments :In such things as integrated circuits,
                 multilayer printed circuit boards, memory speeds, and
                 others have contributed to the ability of computer
                 manufacturers to serve this market. In addition to
                 these developments, however, large advances had to be
                 realized from the standpoint of the basic computer
                 architecture. The concept of pipelining has provided an
                 answer to the large data execution rate required.
                 Pipelined capabilities in the form of arithmetic units
                 and special purpose functional units are included in
                 machines such as the CDC 7600, IBM 360/195, CDC
                 STAR-100, etc. The Texas Instruments Advanced
                 Scientific Computer (ASC) uses the pipeline concept
                 throughout the Central Processor and carries the
                 concept throughout the Central Processor and carries
                 the concept further to include vector instructions in
                 response to the high execution rates required. 3",

                 in space ship computers) where a damaged chip must be
                 localized and replaced. The use of self-checking chips
                 seems to be one of several possible solutions of this
                 problem. The theory of the structure of self-checking
                 logical circuit is covered by literature at least at
                 the fundamental form (see References). However, even
                 when the design principles are supposed to be known,
                 their application to the actual creation of a
                 self-checking circuit of an average complexity is and
                 will remain an art. The reason is quite simple and
                 fundamental optimization of design criteria
                 (engineering qualifications, performance and physical
                 properties of components of the circuits are entities
                 possessing different physical dimensions --- it is
                 impossible to qualify, for instance, two circuits A, B
                 designed for the same task by comparing their speeds
                 and costs if A is faster than B but B is cheaper than
                 A) will never be objective and independent of the
                 talent or whim of the circuit designer.",

                 and multiplication in a computational environment in
                 which all but basic arithmetic operations satisfy
                 ``on-line'' property: to generate $ j^{\mbox {th}} $
                 digits of the result it is necessary and sufficient to
                 have argument(s) available up to the $ (j +
                 \delta)^{\mbox {th}} $ digit, where the index
                 difference $ \delta $ is a small positive
                 constant.

                 Such an environment, due to its potential to perform a
                 sequence of operations in an overlapped fashion, could
                 conveniently speed up an arithmetic multiprocessor
                 structure it could be useful in certain real-time
                 applications, with inherent on-line properties. The
                 on-line property implies a left-to-right digit-by-digit
                 type of algorithm and consequently, a redundant
                 representation, at least of the results. For addition
                 and subtraction such algorithms satisfying on-line
                 property can be easily specified. Multiplication
                 requires a somewhat more elaborate approach and there
                 are several possible ways of defining an on-line
                 algorithm. However, the existence of an on-line
                 division algorithm is not obvious and its analysis
                 appears interesting.",

                 sum, generally at least two logic gate levels after the
                 sum.\par

                 This paper derives expressions for detecting a zero-sum
                 condition concurrently with or even earlier than the
                 determination of the sum digits proper. As a result, a
                 branch operation based on detecting a zero-sum can be
                 executed earlier.",

  abstract =     "Let $ f(x) $ be one of the usual elementary functions
                 ($ \exp $, $ \log $, $ \artan $, $ \sin $, $ \cosh $,
                 etc.), and let $ M(n) $ be the number of
                 single-precision operations required to multiply
                 $n$-bit integers. It is shown that $ f(x) $ can be
                 evaluated, with relative error $ O(2 - n) $, in $
                 O(M(n)l o g (n)) $ operations as $ n \rightarrow \infty
                 $, for any floating-point number $x$ (with an $n$-bit
                 fraction) in a suitable finite interval. From the
                 Sch{\"o}nhage--Strassen bound on $ M(n) $, it follows
                 that an $n$-bit approximation to $ f(x) $ may be
                 evaluated in $ O(n \log_(n) \log \log (n)) $
                 operations. Special cases include the evaluation of
                 constants such as $ \pi $ $e$, and $ e^\pi $. The
                 algorithms depend on the theory of elliptic integrals,
                 using the arithmetic-geometric mean iteration and
                 ascending Landen transformations.",

  abstract =     "An analysis is made of the distribution of trailing
                 digits (tail end digits) of positive real
                 floating-point numbers represented in arbitrary base $
                 \beta $ and randomly chosen from a logarithmic
                 distribution. The analysis shows that the $n$ th digit
                 for $ n \geq 2 $ is actually approximately uniformly
                 distributed. The approximation depends upon both $n$
                 and the base beta. It becomes better as $n$ increases,
                 and it is exact in the limit as $ n \rightarrow \infty
                 $. A table of this distribution is presented for
                 various $ \beta $ and $n$, along with a table of the
                 maximum digit by digit deviation $ \Delta $ of the
                 logarithmic distribution from the uniform distribution.
                 Various asymptotic results for $ \Delta $ are
                 included.",

  abstract =     "This paper deals primarily with the change in
                 practical procedures of calculation which took place
                 during the course of the twelfth century in Western
                 Europe. At the beginning of the period, the abacus was
                 in relatively common use; towards the end, it was being
                 superseded by the method of calculation which was known
                 as the algorism. Certain differences of theory are
                 apparent. Among the textbooks which were most
                 influential in bringing about the change was
                 Sacrobosco's Algorithmus Vulgaris. Authors of both
                 abacus and algorism treatises give an account of
                 number-symbols and discuss elementary number theory
                 briefly, but the algorism treatise show how much more
                 confident the authors were in using Arabic numerals.
                 The algorisms employ a symbol for zero; although it has
                 antecedents in some abacus treatises, its usefulness
                 was clearly not fully perceived by the authors, because
                 the columns of the abacus made it unnecessary to use a
                 counter to indicate that the number under consideration
                 was, for example, 306, not 36. The algorisms deal with
                 a far wider range of operations; while the abacus
                 treatises confine themselves to multiplication and
                 division of whole numbers and fractions, the algorisms
                 have addition, subtraction, doubling, halving,
                 multiplication, division, the extraction of roots and
                 progression, as well as numeration. Changes in
                 technical terminology are discussed. There are two
                 appendices, one dealing with the compilation of
                 arithmetical texts in Bodleian Library Oxford,
                 MS.~Laud.~Misc.~644, and the other on the arithmetical
                 sense of the term equipollentia, which was a technical
                 term of dialectic.",

                 subroutines use single precision chopping arithmetic,
                 and the resulting normalized roundoff error, in
                 computing an $N$-point transform with $ N = \prod_{i =
                 1}^M a_i $ is $ O(M^2) $. This paper proposes a
                 modification of these subroutines for use on computers
                 with a hardwired double precision arithmetic unit. The
                 resulting normalized roundoff error is $ O(M) $ and is
                 independent of the $ a_i $. The modification leads to a
                 negligible increase in storage. For most computers, the
                 increase in the execution time is small. For certain
                 computers, such as IBM System/360 models 91 and 195,
                 the modification can result in a decrease in the

  abstract =     "Recent use of the negabinary system in the application
                 oriented digital hardware, has encouraged the search
                 for suitable arithmetic algorithms in $ - 2 $ base.
                 These algorithms have been directly utilized in
                 designing logic circuits and several logic
                 implementations have been reported in the literature.
                 The main objective of this paper is to show the close
                 relationship between $ + 2 $ base addition and $ - 2 $
                 base negative addition. Two possible ways of utilizing
                 binary adders for performing negabinary addition and
                 their underlying theories are presented. Two similar
                 techniques of using negabinary adders for binary
                 addition are also considered in detail. An interesting
                 aspect of this investigation about negabinary base is
                 that negative addition (rather than just addition)
                 seems to be the primitive operation from logic
                 complexity and interchangeability of $ + 2 $ and $ - 2
                 $ adders point of view.\par

                 The technique of adding two numbers in one system by
                 the adders of the other system is extended here for
                 multiple operand addition. This requires inclusion of
                 an additional correction factor. Further, the additive
                 algorithms of this work lead to four simple conversion
                 processes of number from one system to another. This
                 paper seems to be a realistic step towards the use of
                 similar hardware for $ + 2 $ and $ - 2 $ bases and
                 hence this allows an instantaneous flexibility on the
                 selection of number system. It is believed that this
                 paper will attract more attention on the use of $ - 2 $
                 base system for the design of special purpose digital
                 machines and process controllers.",

  abstract =     "This paper presents the results of one phase of a
                 study concerning methods for addition of $ P > 2 $
                 numbers, each encoded as a vector of digits (digit
                 vector) of length $N$. Such multi-operand addition has
                 been studied most often in the context of reducing a
                 set of partial products to a single result in the
                 implementation of multiplication. More generalized
                 multi-operand addition, most notably in the form of
                 inner product calculations is, however, central to
                 numerous scientific applications of digital computers.
                 Although multioperand addition is trivially
                 accomplished by accumulation (iteration in time) in any
                 general purpose machine, demands for very high-speed
                 computation, typified by 2- and 3-D signal processing
                 prompt implementation of dedicated, hardware-intensive
                 structures for multi-operand addition. This study, for
                 example, is motivated in part by requirements for rapid
                 simultaneous addition of up to 100, 16-bit operands in
                 the design of a dedicated processor for real-time
                 reconstruction of 3-D images of the beating heart and
                 breathing lungs.",

                 in which a 'main' value is computed in addition to the
                 endpoints of the containing interval. The 'main' value
                 is, in general, the value that would have been computed
                 had properly-rounded real arithmetic been used to
                 compute the results of the calculation; it may in some
                 sense, be regarded as the 'most probable' value of the
                 result of the calculation. The endpoints of the
                 interval define the worst-case range of the possible
                 values of the computation. This report describes a
                 FORTRAN implementation of triplex arithmetic in both
                 single and multiple precision. The package described in
                 this report is designed to be used with the AUGMENT
                 precompiler: this makes triplex arithmetic particularly

                 redundant binary adder with two input digits and one
                 output digit, all in the digit set $ \{ \bar {1}, 0, 1
                 \} $. Redundant binary arithmetic structures in which
                 all digit sets are $ \{ \bar {1}, 0, 1 \} $ were first
                 discussed by Avizienis in 1961. Borovec studied the
                 logical design of a class of such binary adders and
                 subtracters in 1968. At that time, a variation of the
                 adder\slash subtracter was overlooked. This paper
                 studies the logical design of this variation. The sum
                 digit is still a function only of the digits in three
                 adjacent digital positions of the operands. ``Coupled
                 don't cares'' are encountered, but have not introduced
                 too much difficulty. The nine distinct formats (under
                 permutation and negation) of representing three values
                 with two bits given by Robertson are used. The simplest
                 adder\slash subtracter designs from this variation are
                 less complex than the simplest designs previously
                 known.",

                 written by Frank Benford, a physicist from the General
                 Electric Company at Schenectady. He had examined a
                 large number of numerical tables, the kind that are
                 printed in almanacs, and in scientific and technical
                 handbooks. He noticed a most unusual and unexpected
                 property of many of these tables. Consider, for
                 example, the numbers representing the populations of
                 states or all the countries in the world, or their
                 areas, their budgets, their numbers of hospital beds,
                 etc. One would expect that on the average just as many
                 of these entries would begin with the digit $1$ as with
                 $2$ or $3$ or $4$, and so on. But Benford noticed that
                 small values of the first digits occur far more

                 fixed-slash and binary floating-slash number
                 representation in computer words are described.
                 Compatibility with standard integer representation is
                 obtained. Redundancy in the representation is shown to
                 be minimal. Arithmetic register requirements are
                 considered. Worst case and average case rounding errors
                 are determined, and the concept of adaptive variable
                 precision in the rounding is developed.",

  abstract =     "This paper reviews past experiences and discusses
                 future work in the area of interval arithmetic at the
                 University of Southwestern Louisiana (USL). Two
                 versions of interval arithmetic were developed and
                 implemented at USL. An interval data type declaration
                 and the necessary mathematical functions for this data
                 type were added to Fortran via the preprocessor Augment
                 (4,5). In the first version the endpoints of the
                 intervals were represented as single precision floating
                 point numbers. In the other version, the endpoints were
                 represented to 56 decimal digits. Production
                 engineering programs were run as benchmarks (8). The
                 accumulation of computational and algorithmic error
                 could be observed as a widening of the intervals. The
                 benchmarks were also run in normal single and double
                 precision arithmetic. In some instances, the result
                 obtained from a single or double precision calculation
                 was not bounded by the corresponding interval result
                 indicating some problem with the algorithm. The
                 widening of an interval does not necessarily indicate a
                 data sensitivity nor error in an algorithm. However,
                 these large intervals can be used as indicator of no
                 problems. As could be expected, the 56-decimal digit
                 precision interval gave better results in terms of
                 smaller intervals due to the increased amount of
                 precision. The obvious problem with this version is
                 that the amount of overhead required for its execution
                 is high.",

                 Announcement: 7804 Abstract: The CRAY-1 is described,
                 the evolution of its architecture is discussed, and an
                 account is given of some of the problems that were
                 overcome during its manufacture. The CRAY-1 is the only
                 computer to have been built to date that satisfies
                 ERDA's Class VI requirement (a computer capable of
                 processing from 20 to 60 million floating point
                 operations per second). The CRAY-1's Fortran compiler
                 (CFT) is designed to give the scientific user immediate
                 access to the benefits of the CRAY-1's vector
                 processing architecture. An optimizing compiler, CFT,
                 ``vectorizes'' innermost DO loops. Compatible with the
                 ANSI 1966 Fortran Standard and with many commonly
                 supported Fortran extensions, CFT does not require any
                 source program modifications or the use of additional
                 nonstandard Fortran statements to achieve
                 vectorization. 6 refs. Descriptors: *COMPUTER

                 are in the focus of the general interest and many
                 papers exist treating that subject. The use of special
                 data encoding techniques, suitable algorithms of
                 arithmetic, special hardware elements have been
                 proposed long ago. The purpose of this paper is to show
                 that the design can produce rather simple self checking
                 circuit when the design principles are chosen which
                 collaborate harmoniously:\par

                 (1) decimal numerical system is used\par

                 (2) decimal digit $ d \in \{ 0, 1, \ldots {}, 9 \} $ is
                 represented in the Diamond Code by the 5-bit binary
                 number $ f = 3 d + 2 $ \par

                 (3) decimal digit' addition algorithm introduced here
                 is simple and effective so that 10 decimal digits can
                 be added in parallel\par

                 (4) implementation of the addition algorithm by
                 conventional Full Adders results in a single fault
                 detecting circuit.\par

                 The design of a decimal adder for 10 decimal numbers,
                 each with 10 digits. is described here as an
                 illustration. It shows the way how to design other
                 decimal arithmetic circuits which are single fault
                 detecting, for instance a multiplier (derived from the
                 adder for 10 decimal numbers).",

                 state-of-the-art of high performance arithmetic
                 integrated circuits (ICs). The survey concentrates on
                 arithmetic ICs that are designed to improve execution
                 speed over software techniques, therefore, no
                 calculator chips are surveyed.\par

                 In order to understand the difficulties encountered in
                 fabricating high speed arithmetic ICs, we start the
                 article with a discussion on semiconductor technology.
                 Next, we survey the various arithmetic elements that
                 are available in monolithic form: ALUs, Data Slices,
                 Multipliers, Floating Point Processors, and ROMs.
                 Finally, we conclude with a comment on digital signal
                 processing and a discussion of the future trends in
                 arithmetic ICs.",

                 exponentials and logarithms advances by 2 bits on the
                 average, yet may not advance at all. Analysis reveals
                 that the no-advance situation actually paves the way
                 for sizable advance in the next iteration, and the
                 guaranteed advance, after a one iteration overhead, is
                 one bit per iteration.\par

                 Two new schemes raise the guaranteed advance to 1.5
                 bits per iteration, after a two-iteration overhead,
                 while maintaining the original requirement of one

                 results have application to computer design. In
                 particular, there are certain values of the base
                 (indeed, $ \beta = 2, 4, 6 $, and sometimes, $8$, but
                 {\em not} $ 16 $ ) which, when carefully balanced with
                 other design parameters, minimize the mean
                 multiplicative error. For these special minimizing
                 situations, it suffices to have only one guard $ \beta
                 $ it provided that postnormalization occurs after
                 symmetric rounding.",

                 base of the number system, precision control, number
                 representation, arithmetic operations, ocher basic
                 operations, elementary functions, and exception
                 handling. The possibility of doing without fixed-point
                 arithmetic is also mentioned. The specifications are
                 intended to be entirely at the level of a programming
                 language such as Fortran. The emphasis is on
                 convenience and simplicity from the user's point of
                 view. Conforming to such specifications would have
                 obvious beneficial implications for the portability of
                 numerical software, and for proving programs correct,
                 as well as attempting to provide facilities which are
                 most suitable for the user. The specifications are not
                 complete in every detail, but it is intended that they
                 be complete ``in spirit'' --- some further details,
                 especially syntactic details, would have to be
                 provided, but the proposals are otherwise relatively

                 to compare the rounding-error behavior of numerical
                 programs. The models follow the approach, popularized
                 by Wilkinson, of assuming independent rounding errors
                 in each arithmetic operation. Models constructed on
                 this assumption are more tractable than would be the
                 case under more realistic assumptions. There are
                 identified two easily tested conditions on programs
                 which guarantee that error analyses are relatively
                 insensitive to the particular graph model employed. The
                 development has the additional benefit of sometimes
                 providing an elementary proof that one program is
                 comparable in stability to another. Examples of such
                 results are given.",

  abstract =     "A standard for binary floating-point arithmetic is
                 being proposed and there is a very real possibility
                 that it will be adopted by many manufacturers and
                 implemented on a wide range of computers. This
                 development matters to all of us concerned with
                 numerical software. One of the principal motivations
                 for the standard is to distribute more evenly the
                 burden of portability between hardware and software. At
                 present, any program intended to be portable must be
                 designed for a mythical computer that enjoys no
                 capability not supported by every computer on which the
                 program will be run. That mythical computer is so much
                 grubbier than almost any real computer that a portable
                 program will frequently be denigrated as ``suboptimal''
                 and then supplanted by another program supposedly
                 ``optimal'' for the real computer in question but often
                 inferior in critical respects like reliability. A
                 standard --- almost any reasonable standard --- will
                 surely improve the situation. A standard environment
                 for numerical programs will promote fair comparisons
                 and sharing of numerical codes, thereby lowering costs
                 and prices. Furthermore, we have chosen repeatedly to
                 enrich that environment in order that applications
                 programs be simpler and more reliable. Thus will the
                 onus of portability be shared among hardware
                 manufacturers and software producers.",

  abstract =     "Certain pairs of arguments to the residue function, as
                 implemented on many APL systems, give results which
                 make it seem as if the ordinary decimal relationships
                 we remember from grade school no longer hold. As far as
                 we can tell, it looks as if a given modulus should
                 divide the right argument, but the implementation tells
                 us it doesn't. A definition for a fuzzed residue
                 function is proposed which resolves the difficulties
                 users have complained of. However, certain points of
                 continuing difficulty remain, where the limitations of
                 machine arithmetic continue to defeat the attempt to
                 model the real number system. The representation
                 function is defined in terms of the residue function,
                 and so is affected by the change in residue. The nature
                 of this effect is also discussed in this paper.",

  abstract =     "Codes constructed in a Residue Number System (RNS) of
                 moduli $ m_1, m_2, \ldots {}, m_n $ are non-binary,
                 arithmetic codes whose codewords are vectors where the
                 $i$ th component is $ m_i $-valued $ (1 \leq i \leq n)
                 $. A new class of codes in RNS is described, where
                 redundancy is introduced by removing the constraint
                 that the moduli of the RNS be pairwise prime. The
                 error-detecting and correcting capabilities of such
                 codes are discussed and a simple approach to error
                 detection, localization and correction is presented.
                 Although the codes under consideration are quite
                 inefficient in some respects, it is shown that codes is
                 examined in more detail. Codes in this subclass,
                 besides correcting all single errors, also correct
                 almost all of double errors and localize some errors of
                 higher multiplicity, with less redundancy than required
                 to construct optimal 2-correcting codes in RNS.",

  abstract =     "The design of IBM's 4341 Processor, as with other
                 processors, involved many cost/performance tradeoffs.
                 The designer is continually under pressure to increase
                 processor speed without increasing cost or to decrease
                 processor cost without decreasing performance. This
                 paper will examine some of the engineering decisions
                 that were made in the attempt to make the 4341 a
                 high-performing yet low cost processor. These decisions
                 include searching for, or developing, algorithms that
                 make the best use of hardware properties, such as data
                 path width, arithmetic/logical operations and special
                 functions. Functions were sought such that a small
                 amount of added hardware would go a long way towards
                 improving system performance. Hardware designers,
                 microcoders and performance analysis people worked
                 together to implement instructions, functions and
                 algorithms with the proper mixture of hardware
                 functions and microcode in order to build a viable
                 processor. Some specific functions will be covered to
                 examine a few of the decisions. The TEST UNDER MASK
                 performance problem will be discussed with its
                 resulting implementation decision. The method of using
                 EXCLUSIVE OR to clear storage and the resulting
                 algorithm design will be shown. Other topics to be
                 discussed include multiple hardware functions and the
                 resulting effect on floating point, fixed point and
                 decimal multiply; the divide function and its effect on
                 floating point and fixed point divide; and the effect
                 of an 8-byte data path for decimal arithmetic.",

                 organized around a file format having a floating point
                 numeric domain exceeding that of any single or double
                 precision floating point numbers, long or short integer
                 words or BCD data upon which it must operate. As a
                 result the circuit has a greater reliability, range and
                 precision than ever previously achieved without
                 entailing additional circuit complexity. Reliability is
                 further enhanced by a systematic three bit rounding
                 field, and by including means for detecting every error
                 or exception condition with an optional expected
                 response provided thereto by hardware. As a result of
                 such organization, an unexpected increase of capacity
                 is achieved wherein transcendental functions can be
                 computed totally in hardware, and whereby mixed mode
                 arithmetic can be implemented without difficulty. The

                 capable of arbitrary numbers of bit and byte shifts in
                 a single clock cycle, as well as an arithmetic unit

                 by Control Data in which a small staff of engineers was
                 isolated from the main operations of the company. Some
                 review is made of the design process as well as the
                 unique features of the machine. The article also
                 includes some comments in retrospect about the results
                 of certain of the initial design objectives.",

                 package for FORTRAN has been developed by substituting
                 the multiple precision arithmetic package of Richard P.
                 Brent for the underlying arithmetic in the author's
                 earlier single precision interval arithmetic package.
                 This package, like the earlier version, offers a
                 complete range of operations and functions for interval
                 calculations.\par

                 In this paper, we outline the design philosophy of the
                 earlier package and show how this design facilitated
                 the incorporation of the Brent package. We discuss
                 several desirable host system features and possible
                 adaptations of the interval package, and explain how
                 the design of the package would allow it to serve in
                 differing environments with only relatively minor
                 changes.\par

                 Since the package may be of direct use to many
                 individuals, we also discuss its installation on other
                 host systems and its use via the AUGMENT precompiler
                 for Fortran.",

                 instructions represent total functions. In fact this is
                 not always the case: for instance, in dealing with real
                 numbers, Brown's model of floating point computation
                 [1], a model which has been accepted by the designers
                 of ADA, uses interval analysis. If the interval of x
                 overlaps the interval of y, the Boolean value of x r y
                 is not well defined.\par

                 In this paper the author studies the clean termination
                 (i.e., without abortion) of iterative programs, not
                 supposing that the test functions are total. The
                 relational approach to computing, which the author has
                 largely worked out (cf. Sanderson [2] for an account
                 from the starting point) is very well suited for that
                 design. A general theorem links the ``global
                 correctness'' of a program with a ``well-founded''
                 breakdown of the program relation. Next the author
                 gives new validation rules, in which a Z b depart from
                 the usual meaning. Last (but not least) one finds an

  abstract =     "This paper describes the design of an arithmetic unit
                 called CADAC (Clean Arithmetic with Decimal base And
                 Controlled Precision). A brief indication of
                 programming language specifications for carrying out
                 ``ideal'' floating-point arithmetic is given. These
                 specifications include detailed requirements for
                 precision control and exception handling at the level
                 of a programming language such as Fortran. CADAC is an
                 arithmetic unit which performs the four floating-point
                 operations add\slash subtract \slash multiply\slash
                 divide on decimal base numbers in accordance with the
                 language requirements. A three-level pipeline is used
                 to overlap 2-digit-at-a-time (``double digit'') serial
                 processing of the partial products\slash remainders.
                 Although the logic design is relatively complex, the
                 performance is efficient and the advantages gained by
                 implementing programmer-controlled precision directly
                 in the hardware are significant.",

                 extent are the high-bandwidth computations of
                 elementary functions, which are relatively
                 time-consuming procedures when conducted in software.
                 In this paper, we elaborate on a technique for
                 computing piecewise quadratic approximations to many
                 elementary functions. This method permits the effective

                 rapidly generating single-precision floating-point
                 function values (e.g., 30-45 bits of fraction, with
                 current RAM and ROM technology). The technique, based
                 on the use of Taylor series, may be readily pipelined.

                 in certain respects. For instance, it is not in a

                 the form $ \{ f(x, y, \ldots {}, z) : x \in X. y \in Y,

                 number. In extreme cases in which the entire word is
                 not long enough to contain the exponent, they move to a
                 different ``level'' and work with exponents of
                 exponents. They have implemented the scheme in
                 software, and they claim that a hardware implementation
                 is possible without loss of efficiency. Their examples
                 include Graeffe's method, which seems to survive better

                 application and realization technology. In computer
                 arithmetic we are concerned with establishing a
                 correspondence between abstract quantities (numbers)
                 and some physical representation (symbols), and with
                 simulating the operations on these symbols. The ADS is
                 intended to help study the cost and performance of
                 alternate simulations. A finite number system is a
                 triple consisting of a symbol set (elements are called
                 ``digit-vectors''), an interpretation set, a mapping
                 between these two sets, and a set of operators
                 (digit-vector algorithms) defined on its symbol set. A
                 set of these digit vector algorithms are proposed for
                 conducting arithmetic design. A number system matrix

                 systems and a method for computing time and space
                 complexity of compositions of these algorithms is

                 algorithms. The simulator was designed primarily to

                 error detecting and correcting codes. The addition,
                 multiplication and division in the field $ \mathrm

                 Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (whose German
                 acronym is ETH) during the 1950s. Despite the more
                 general title, he does not mention any non-ETH
                 computers in this article. According to Schwartz, the
                 first programmable computer in Switzerland was the Z4
                 developed by Konrad Zuse in Germany during World War II
                 and installed at the ETH in 1950. Except for the ERMETH
                 (also at the ETH), he does not mention any subsequent
                 Swiss installations during the period, leaving a weak
                 implication that there were none.\par

                 The Z4 was an electromechanical machine with a total
                 data memory of 64 32-bit words and no program memory.
                 Programs were executed while being read from punched
                 tape. Conditional test instructions permitted
                 instructions on the tape to be skipped; other control
                 instructions caused an alternate tape reader to begin
                 processing a program (a form of subroutine-call). The
                 arithmetic unit could perform true floating-point
                 operations. This arithmetic unit contained built-in
                 functions for computing squares, reciprocals, and
                 square roots. (Ten years later, mere integer division
                 was still optional at an extra cost on the IBM 1401.)
                 There were special representations for infinity and
                 ``undefined'' so that operations such as division by
                 zero could continue without interruption but with a
                 meaningful result.",

                 estimates the next remainder's leading bits. The
                 quotient digit look-up table is addressed with a
                 truncation of the estimate rather than a truncation of
                 the full partial remainder. The estimation ALU and the
                 look-up table are asymmetric for positive and negative
                 remainders. This asymmetry reduces the width of the ALU
                 and the number of minterms in the logic equations for
                 the look-up table. The square root algorithm obtains
                 the correctly rounded result in about two division
                 times using small extensions to the division
                 hardware.",

  content =      "This paper describes the logical design of a floating
                 point arithmetic unit using a hybrid residue number
                 system. Mantissas of numbers are operated in a residue
                 system while the exponents are in binary. Some basic
                 operations, such as scaling and underflow/overflow
                 detection, are described, and circuit implementation
                 using ROMs indicated. ``For example, let m(z)` be a
                 2N-bit work in integer form and H_0 and H_1 represent
                 the two following hypotheses. If m(z`) e H_1, then
                 m(z`) W 1-2- 2^2N = 2^2N 1. If m(z)` e H_0, then m(z)`
                 < 1-2- 2^2N = 2^2N 1. The hypothesis testing is
                 accomplished by comparing each of the mixed-radix
                 digits of m(z)` to that of 2^2N 1 through L independent
                 binary comparators.'' Circuits for multiplication,
                 addition, and subtraction are derived. The procedures
                 seem reasonable and the proofs rigorous. Table look up
                 cycle times and memory requirements for different
                 implementation of the arithmetic units are estimated.
                 These are comparable with corresponding times and
                 memory needs for PDP/11. Use in algorithms such as FFT
                 is argued for.\par

                 The exposition is somewhat difficult. As with many
                 logical designs one is not sure whether the approach
                 given is optimum (for any sense of the word
                 ``optimum''). In the absence of a working system one
                 can not be sure",

                 high-level language.\par

                 computers.\par

                 * An early introduction to machine language to explain
                 the functioning of a computer, and then a lead-in into
                 Assembler language.\par

                 * Development of the use of registers, Assembler
                 Directives, indexing, immediate operands, arithmetic
                 for signed and unsigned data, subroutines, stacks,
                 passing parameters, input/output, floating-point
                 arithmetic, and more.\par

                 themselves with what the machine designers offered and
                 be glad that the hardware worked at all. Later, with
                 the introduction of higher-level languages, the
                 computing environment was modified by the language
                 designers who attempted to resolve a three-cornered
                 tug-of-war among implementation efficiency, program
                 portability, and usefulness to the programmer. The
                 conflict between the first two resulted in languages
                 that reflected the least common denominator of
                 available hardware, since language designers were
                 disinclined to mention any capability not available on
                 all computers. A case in point is floating-point
                 arithmetic, where the subtleties of overflow,
                 underflow, and rounding are generally well beyond the
                 control of the programmer in a high-level language. The
                 new standard for binary floating-point arithmetic that
                 has been proposed by IEEE Computer Society's
                 Floating-Point Committee, Task P754 [1], makes an

                 implemented easily on a microcomputer or a computer
                 with microprogrammable arithmetic operations. In
                 addition, for accurate final results, a compiler is
                 necessary which will select the appropriate operations.
                 A language of this type (PASCAL-SC) was developed.
                 Along with accurate real arithmetic, this compiler
                 provides accurate complex arithmetic, real and complex
                 interval arithmetic, and vector and matrix arithmetic
                 over these data types. Some features of PASCAL-SC
                 related to scientific and engineering computation are
                 described. In most cases, the operations of accurate
                 arithmetic are performed at the same speed as ordinary
                 (uncontrolled) floating-point arithmetic.",

  content =      "The computation of the solution of a linear system
                 whose entries are indeterminates or polynomials is of
                 interest both for theoretic and practical reasons. The
                 similar problem of computing the determinant is
                 important because of the relationship of the
                 determinant and resultant to factorization, polynomial
                 greatest-common-divisor calculations, and computation
                 with algebraic functions. Engineering application areas
                 of this material include the analysis of electrical or
                 other networks.\par

                 These computation problems are quite distinct from
                 others which would appear to be superficially similar,
                 namely numerical linear algebra problems. The result of
                 computing a numerical determinant is a floating point
                 number with an associated error. The result of
                 computing an exact algebraic determinant is, typically,
                 a large expression whose terms may be rearranged into
                 various ``factored'' forms for savings in computation
                 time and space. This answer has no error
                 whatsoever.\par

                 Clever and efficient programs in each domain have been
                 shown to be disastrous in the other. Thus one of the
                 best algebraic techniques for determinant calculations
                 for ``sparse polynomial'' matrices is expansion by
                 minors [1]; whereas Gaussian elimination is far

                 $ (\log^2 n) $ time $n$-bit binary parallel multiplier
                 for two unsigned operands. Proposed design consists of
                 partitioning the multiplier and multiplicand bits into
                 four groups of $ n / 4 $ bits each and then reducing
                 the matrix of sixteen product terms using three to two
                 parallel counters and Brent-Kung $ (\log n) $ time
                 parallel adder. Area-time performance of the present
                 scheme has been compared with the existing schemes for
                 parallel multipliers. Regular and recursive design of
                 the multiplier is shown to be suitable for VLSI
                 implementation and an improved table look up multiplier
                 has been used to form the basis of the recursive design
                 scheme.",

                 reliability of arithmetic units. An error model is then
                 presented: this model well represents the faulty
                 behavior of many arithmetic units. The Residue Number
                 System and its related properties are used in order to
                 obtain a simple architecture (called Reliability
                 Network, R-Net). The main characteristics of the
                 presented technique are a significant reduction in the
                 number of gates and a limited increase of global
                 execution times. The extensive use of combinational
                 logic makes it possible to implement the R-Net almost
                 completely by means of Programmable Logic Arrays
                 (PLA's). Finally, both the intrinsic regularity of the
                 R-Net and its simple internal interconnection scheme
                 make this approach suitable for a practical VLSI
                 implementation.",

                 correction in the communication and processing of

                 cost-effective arithmetic error code applications offer
                 an attractive alternative.\par

                 Part I of this paper presents a generalization of
                 low-cost inverse residue codes into two-dimensional
                 encodings. Error detecting and error correcting
                 properties of two-dimensional inverse residue codes are

                 Part II discusses a multi-phase application of inverse
                 residue codes in which the form of encoding is altered
                 and additional time is allocated after faults occur.
                 The goal is to defer repair and to continue operation
                 at a slower speed until scheduled maintenance can take

                 called CADAC (clean arithmetic with decimal base and
                 controlled precision). Programming language
                 specifications for carrying out `ideal' floating-point
                 arithmetic are described first. These specifications
                 include detailed requirements for dynamic precision
                 control and exception handling, along with both complex
                 and interval arithmetic at the level of a programming
                 language such as Fortran or PL/I.\par

                 CADAC is an arithmetic unit which performs the four
                 floating-point operations add\slash subtract\slash
                 multiply\slash divide on decimal numbers in such a way

                 (a**2 plus b**2)** one-half of two real numbers a and
                 b. This algorithm is immune to unwarranted
                 floating-point overflows, has a cubic rate of
                 convergence, and is easily transportable. This paper,
                 which shows that the algorithm is essentially Halley's
                 method applied to the computation of square roots,
                 provides a generalization to any order of convergence.
                 Formulas of orders 2 through 9 are illustrated with
                 numerical examples. The generalization keeps the number
                 of floating-point divisions constant and should be
                 particularly useful for computation in high-precision
                 floating-point arithmetic.",

                 selection of quotient digits is described. The proposed
                 scheme is a combination of the multiplicative
                 normalization used in the continued-product algorithms
                 and the recursive division algorithm. The scheme
                 consists of two parts: in the first part, the divisor
                 and the dividend are transformed into the range which
                 allows the quotient digits to be selected by rounding
                 partial remainders to the most significant radix-$r$
                 digit in the second part. Since the selection requires
                 only the most significant part of the partial
                 remainder, limited carry-propagation adders can be used
                 to form the partial remainders. The divisor and
                 dividend transformations are performed in three steps
                 using multipliers of the form $ 1 + s_k r^{-k} $ as in
                 the continued product algorithm. The higher radix of
                 the form $ r = 2^k, k = 2, 4, 8, \ldots {} $ can be
                 used to reduce the number of steps while retaining the
                 simple quotient selection rules.",

                 implementation because of the regularity in their
                 iterative structure. However, most VLSI circuits are
                 very difficult to test. This paper shows that, with
                 appropriate cell design, array multipliers can be
                 designed to be very easily-testable. An array
                 multiplier is called C-testable if all its adder cells
                 can be exhaustively tested while requiring only a
                 constant number of test patterns. The testability of
                 two well-known array multiplier structures are [sic]
                 studied. The conventional design of the carry-save
                 array multiplier is shown to be not C-testable.
                 However, a modified design, using a modified adder
                 cell, is generated and shown to be C-testable and
                 requires only 16 test patterns. Similar results are
                 obtained for the Baugh--Wooley two's complement array
                 multiplier. A modified design of the Baugh--Wooley
                 array multiplier is shown to be C-testable and requires
                 55 test patterns. The implementation of a practical
                 C-testable $ 16 \times 16 $ array multiplier is also

                 where $k$ is a small constant. This digit serial

                 flush times of a chained array of digit online
                 arithmetic units and to reduce their VLSI
                 interconnection complexity. However, because of this
                 digit serial property, unique and inherent limitations
                 may have to be imposed on any arithmetic unit which
                 performs digit online operations. For some
                 calculations, these limitations may be so severe as to
                 make digit online evaluation virtually impossible. We
                 show several important signal processing problems where
                 these limitations have either been avoided or their

                 arithmetic following (almost) the IEEE standard defined
                 in (1). The description is more directly
                 algorithm-oriented than the `Implementation Guide' for
                 this standard (2), since the latter does not treat an
                 actual implementation. The article consists of two
                 parts. One concerns the problem of getting the
                 preliminary result from each of the arithmetic
                 operations, this result is the basis for a correct
                 rounding. The other part treats the multiword
                 arithmetic, i.e., the routines to perform an $ m \times
                 n $ bit operation, using the corresponding $n$ bit
                 operation supplied by the hardware. Only multiplication
                 and division are described, since the add\slash
                 subtract routines are trivial. For division also a
                 method for getting an $n$ bit inverse is included,
                 since the hardware in the case had no division

  abstract =     "This paper presents a novel arithmetic scheme for a
                 high-speed adaptive learning network (ALN) element. An
                 ALN is a self-organizing scheme for implementing the
                 Kolmogorov--Gabor (K-G) polynomial which maps an input
                 vector $X$ into an output scalar $Y$. In the first
                 layer of an ALN there are $ n(n - 1) / 2 $ elements. In
                 the next layer the number of elements needed depends
                 upon the number of outputs that are propagated from the
                 first layer. In this paper only the design of a single
                 element is considered. An array of memories (RAMs) and
                 a parallel adder are used to perform multinomial
                 arithmetic for the element. The memory array contains
                 subfunction values which are calculated by an external
                 host computer and downloaded to the memory array. All
                 the memories operate on the input variables
                 concurrently via a common address bus. The subfunction
                 values from the memory array are then summed by a
                 parallel adder to obtain the output of the element.
                 complete ALN implemented with the proposed ALN elements
                 has advantages in operation speed and less hardware.",

                 parallel reduction of three summands to two, their sum

                 carry-save addition of three summands, positive and
                 negative as well. The two result summands form a
                 successive partial remainder. Their most significant
                 three-bit groups are used to determine the ``digits''
                 $1$, $0$, $ + 1 $ of the square root in a redundant
                 notation. These digits are transformed into the
                 conventional-notation bits, which are used in the
                 further steps of the square-rooting process",

                 and produces a scalar output. This class of vector
                 operations forms the basis of many scientific
                 computations. In a pipelined processor, a feedback loop
                 is required to reduce vectors. Since the output of the
                 pipeline depends on previous outputs, improper control
                 of the feedback loop will destroy the benefit from
                 pipelining. A generalized computing model is proposed
                 to schedule the activities in a vector reduction
                 pipeline. Two new vector reduction methods, symmetric
                 and asymmetric, are proposed and analyzed for pipelined
                 processing. These two methods compare favorably with
                 the known recursive reduction method in achieving
                 higher pipeline utilization and in eliminating large
                 memory for intermediate results. An interleaving method
                 is proposed to reduce multiple vectors to multiple
                 scalars in a single arithmetic pipeline. The pipeline
                 can be fully utilized by interleaved multiple vector
                 processing.",

  abstract =     "This report is a companion to Reference 1 on radian
                 reduction. As in Reference 1 \cite{Payne:1983:RRT}, the
                 motivation arises from a desire to eliminate messages
                 like ``argument too large'' in trigonometric function
                 routines. The presence of very large arguments in the
                 VAX H format, on the Cray 1, and on an IEEE machine
                 with extended registers, make this a real problem. As
                 for the radian reduction algorithm, the degree
                 algorithm will reduce any argument, however large, so
                 long as it is representable; its speed is nearly
                 independent of the size of the argument to be reduced;
                 and full accuracy is maintained in the neighborhoods of
                 the zeros of the desired function. We believe that the
                 approach is new and represents a significant
                 improvement over procedures currently in use. A variant
                 of the procedure is used in Version 3 of the VAX Math
                 Library.",

  abstract =     "An accurate reduction poses little difficulty for
                 arguments of a few radians. However for, say, a CRAY 1,
                 H format on the VAX, or double extended in the proposed
                 IEEE standard, the maximum argument which might be
                 presented for reduction is of the order of $ 2^{16000}
                 $ radians. Accurate reduction of such an argument would
                 require storage of $ \pi $ (or its reciprocal) to over
                 16,000 bits. Direct reduction by division (or
                 multiplication) then requires generation of a somewhat
                 larger number of bits in the result in order to
                 guarantee the accuracy of the reduction. Of these bits
                 only the low few bits of the integer part of the
                 quotient (product) and enough bits to correctly round
                 the remainder are relevant; the rest will be
                 discarded.",

                 power in algorithms where the data may be recast into
                 disjoint data sets, all acted upon concurrently, each
                 by a different operand common to the set. But the
                 multi-operand approach can also serve to enhance
                 arithmetic operations significantly. The speed-up of
                 associative multiplication by handling a number of
                 multiplier bits at a time is described and analyzed,
                 including an effective algorithm for a limited sum of
                 products. The most complex process treated is
                 convolution, which serves to illustrate the enhancement
                 of an extended sum of products. Any number of vectors
                 stored in memory can be convolved simultaneously by a
                 common filter vector. Execution time is 45 milliseconds
                 for 1024 element data and filter vectors, 2048 element
                 results, and 16-bit precision.",

  abstract =     "In the fall of 1977 the Institute of Electrical and
                 Electronics Engineers commissioned working group 754 to
                 draft a standard for binary floating-point arithmetic.
                 It was intended to prevent the proliferation of
                 disparate arithmetics in the new microprocessor
                 industry. At that time there were so many different
                 flavors of arithmetic available on mainframes and
                 minicomputers that the cost of reconciling their
                 differences in numerical software had become, and
                 remains, staggering. Now, more than five years later,
                 draft 10.0 of the proposed standard has been voted out
                 of the working group for IEEE approval.\par

                 This thesis consists of a set of ``footnotes'' to the
                 proposed standard. The first of them, an implementation
                 guide published in January 1980, served as a working
                 draft of the standard for over a year. The remaining
                 chapters unfolded as the proposed standard did. They
                 include an analysis of gradual underflow, the most
                 controversial feature of the standard; an exhaustive
                 discussion of radix conversion, which has been
                 specified in the proposed standard only up to a
                 worst-case error bound; and a revised version of the
                 arithmetic test suite which has been available in
                 machine-readable form from the working group.",

  abstract =     "One way of classifying computer languages is by two
                 classes: languages needing skilled programmers, and
                 personal languages used by an expanding population of
                 general users. REstructured eXtended eXecutor (REXX) is
                 a flexible personal language designed with particular
                 attention to feedback from its users. It has proved to
                 be effective and easy to use, yet it is sufficiently
                 general and powerful to fulfill the needs of many
                 demanding professional applications. REXX is system and
                 hardware independent, so that it has been possible to
                 integrate it experimentally into several operating
                 systems. Here REXX is used for such purposes as command
                 and macro programming, prototyping, education, and
                 personal programming. This study introduces REXX and
                 describes the basic design principles that were
                 followed in developing it.",

                 interested in learning the basics of computer
                 organization, particularly at the hardware and device
                 level. This book does not deal with the concepts
                 related to computer organization from an abstract,
                 mathematical level. It also does not attempt to
                 describe the computer organization using a high-level
                 language. Instead, the authors concentrate on
                 uniprocessing systems, with a large number of examples
                 drawn from VAX-11, IBM 370, and HP 3000. The book does
                 not cover multiprocessors.\par

                 The organization of the book is summarized here.
                 Chapter 1 introduces a number of terms. Chapters 2 and
                 3 concentrate in detail (a total of 101 pages) on the
                 addressing methods and instruction sets, with examples
                 taken primarily from the above mentioned machines.
                 Chapters 4 and 5 (a total of 50 pages) deal with the
                 control unit for the instruction fetch and execute,
                 with Chapter 5 being devoted to microprogrammed control
                 and bit slice designs. In Chapter 6 (a total of 64
                 pages) the authors cover Input/Output organization,
                 which includes a good deal about the
                 synchronous/asynchronous I/O operations, I/O
                 interfaces, etc. Chapter 7 presents the usual material
                 on the fixed- and floating-point arithmetic. \ldots{}",

  abstract =     "Multiple-precision arithmetic overcomes the round-off
                 error incurred in conventional floating-point
                 arithmetic, at the cost of increased processing
                 overhead. Significance arithmetic takes into account
                 the inexactness of the operands of a calculation, but
                 can lead to loss of significant digits after a long
                 series of operations. A new technique is described
                 which alleviates the overhead of multiple-precision
                 arithmetic by allowing nonsignificant digits to be
                 discarded, while limiting the significance loss per
                 operation to a controllable and acceptable rate. The
                 technique is based on storing an inexact number
                 interval, using a criterion of significance to
                 determine the precision with which the limits of
                 interval should be stored. A procedure referred to as a
                 significance rule uses this criterion to remove some of
                 the nonsignificant digits from the limits of an
                 interval prior to storage. A certain number of
                 nonsignificant digits are retained as guard digits.
                 Calculations are performed using exact interval
                 arithmetic and the significance-rule procedure is
                 invoked after each operation to remove superfluous
                 digits. Round-off in the procedure causes a slight
                 increase in the interval width on each operation. This
                 results in a cumulative loss of significance at a rate
                 related to the number of guard digits.",

  abstract =     "The VAX-11/7801 was designed specifically to implement
                 the VAX architecture. As such, it does not support the
                 IEEE standard for floating point arithmetic. A project
                 was undertaken to provide this support by modifying the
                 11/780 microarchitecture. Our objective was to produce
                 a microengine that would efficiently execute the VAX
                 instruction set, modified to handle VAX floating point
                 instructions in accordance with the IEEE standard. Our
                 methodology was to make minimal changes to the 11/780
                 hardware, relying primarily on changes to the
                 microcode. This paper describes the modifications
                 required to implement the IEEE standard, examines the
                 various design alternatives available to us, presents
                 measurements of our implementation, and analyzes our
                 results. We also offer some comments on the matter of
                 retrofitting an existing architecture to a new
                 unintended use.",

                 generation of tight and guaranteed bounds on the
                 computed solution of numerical problems in cases where
                 some of the original data values are not representable
                 exactly as machine numbers. At present, such data
                 values must be replaced by enclosing machine intervals;
                 for ill-conditioned problems, the final interval
                 defining the solution may be relatively wide.\par

                 The authors here discuss the implementation of some
                 earlier ideas of Stetter's [1], relating to the
                 coupling of a conversion procedure for decimal data to
                 the evaluation algorithm proper, with the objective of
                 generating much narrower inclusions. A clear indication
                 of how this might be done is presented by means of an
                 illustrative example. A detailed specification is given
                 for a linear equation solver which should compute last
                 bit accurate inclusions of the solution for decimal
                 data using a hexadecimal machine. Also included are
                 four varied numerical examples, for which the results
                 are most impressive, and which appear to justify the
                 authors' claim. \par

  abstract =     "The symmetric eigenvalue problem is one of the most
                 fundamental problems of computational mathematics. It
                 arises in many applications, and therefore represents
                 an important area for algorithmic research. It is also
                 one of the first eigenvalue problems for which reliable
                 methods have been obtained. It would be surprising
                 therefore, if a new method were to be found that would
                 offer a significant improvement in execution time over
                 the fundamental algorithms available in standard
                 software packages such as EISPACK [7]. However, it is
                 reasonable to expect that eigenvalue calculations might
                 be accelerated through the use of parallel algorithms
                 for parallel computers that are emerging. We shall
                 present such an algorithm in this paper. The algorithm
                 is able to exploit parallelism at all levels of the
                 computation and is well suited to a variety of
                 architectures. However, a pleasant bonus of this
                 research is that the parallel algorithm, even when run
                 in serial mode, is significantly faster than the best
                 sequential algorithm on large problems, and is
                 effective on moderate size (order $ \geq 30 $ )

                 numbers and a rounding rule $P$. One such number system

                 reduced-instruction-set processors do not support
                 hardware floating-point operations. Instead, floating
                 point operations have to be provided either by a

                 issues arising from a software implementation of
                 floating point arithmetic for the MIPS processor, an
                 experimental VLSI architecture. Measurements indicate
                 that an acceptable level of performance is achieved.
                 but this approach is no substitute for a hardware
                 accelerator if higher precision results are required,
                 This paper includes instruction profiles for the basic
                 floating point operations and evaluates the usefulness
                 of some aspects of the instruction set.",

                 advertised as reliable and easy to use; but sometimes
                 its results must astonish or confuse a naive user, This
                 report exhibits a few of the surprises. For instance, a
                 finite continued fraction, easy to evaluate in two
                 dozen keystrokes on a handheld calculator, causes
                 ACRITH to overflow either exponent range or 15
                 Megabytes of virtual memory. Lacking access to source
                 code, we must speculate to explain the anomalies. Some
                 seem attributable to small bugs in the code; some to
                 optimistic claims or oversimplifications in the code's
                 documentation; some to flaws in the doctrine underlying
                 the code. We conclude that different techniques than
                 used by ACRITH might have been about as accurate and
                 yet more economical, robust and perspicuous.",

                 System (RNS) is suggested. It works with the code whose
                 redundancy is in the form of magnitude indices. The
                 residue representation of a number with magnitude index
                 is reconsidered. The RNS with magnitude index were
                 first studied by Sasaki [16] and Rao [15] and then by
                 Barsi and Maestrini [5,6]. The range of a given RNS is
                 divided into intervals of equal width and the magnitude
                 of a number X is defined as a integer locating X into
                 one of such intervals. We have proposed algorithm which
                 detects and corrects multiple errors in residue number.
                 The algorithms for special cases viz., single burst
                 residue error and single residue error are also

                 Fields. In this paper, we explain the design of a
                 ``Polynomial Transformer'' which executes the
                 transformation.\par

                 Polynomial Transformer consists of very simple and
                 iterative logic, and it is very suitable for parallel
                 and pipelined VLSI algorithm. Moreover, three
                 dimensional construction of a Polynomial Transformer is
                 possible. Thus, it serves as an example of a typical
                 three dimensional VLSI.\par

                 Its application can be found in Polynomial
                 Transformation, disturbance of data and so on.",

                 arithmetic function and is fundamental to many
                 statistical sampling and statistical pattern
                 recognition problems. Computation of the cumulative
                 hypergeometric distribution function, $ H(a) $, is
                 extremely time-consuming. As a result, many
                 approximation algorithms have been proposed to evaluate
                 the cumulative hypergeometric distribution. This paper
                 describes a two-level pipeline architecture for
                 computing $ H(a) $ with computation complexity reduced
                 to $ c + a $, where $c$ is a constant. The main part of
                 the design is a type of recurrence computation. A
                 modular and systematic approach is suggested to
                 implement the recurrence formula. The computation
                 complexity of the proposed architecture is also
                 compared with various other known methods. The highly
                 regular structure of the design can lead to efficient
                 VLSI implementation.",

  abstract =     "A Modified CORDIC Algorithm (MCA) has been developed
                 for the evaluation of elementary arithmetic functions.
                 MCA incorporates increased parallelism over the
                 original CORDIC algorithm, thus, resulting in an
                 enhanced speed of computation. This has been
                 accomplished by decoupling the CORDIC iteration
                 equations, and transforming the sequential nature of
                 these equations. $n$-bit fixed point data operands are
                 assumed and the parameter $k$ relates to the level of
                 parallelism in the algorithm. The modified algorithm
                 employs a $ [k + 1]n^2 $-bit ROM for lookup tables that
                 enable elementary arithmetic functions to be evaluated
                 in no more than $ [3 n + 2] $ and no less than $2$ time
                 steps. The two bounds correspond to a pipelined and a
                 parallel implementation, respectively. The formulation
                 of the MCA can be manipulated to obtain implementations
                 with various speed\slash cost characteristics. This
                 compares to $ n(3 n + 1) / 2 $ time steps for the
                 original CORDIC algorithm. For example, 32-bit ALU has
                 $ k = 12 $ and $ n = 32 $; so, a 13,312-bit ROM is
                 required to store the lookup tables, and the
                 computation requires 98 time steps for a pipelined
                 implementation.",

                 design is the obvious choice [OnAt83, BaJM83]. However,
                 the direct implementation of a CLA adder in VLSI faces
                 some undesirable limitations. Either the design lacks
                 regularity, thus increasing the design and

                 too long, thus causing area-time inefficiency and
                 limits on the size of addition. Brent and Kung solved
                 the regularity problem by reformulating the carry chain
                 computation [BrKu82]. They showed that an $n$-bit
                 addition can be performed in time $ O(\log n) $, using
                 area $ O(n \log n) $ with maximum interconnection wire
                 length $ O(n) $. In this paper, we give an alternative
                 $ \log n $ stage design which is nearly optimum with
                 respect to regularity, area-time efficiency, and
                 maximum interconnection wire length.",

                 presented using Read-Only-Associative Memories (ROAMs),
                 such as PLAs. These memories have considerable
                 advantages for table lookup arithmetic processing over
                 the conventional ROMs in terms of their storage and
                 time efficiency. In residue arithmetic, the ROAM
                 storage required largely depends on the residue
                 recurrences in arithmetic tables modulo $M$. After
                 reviewing recent results on the computation of
                 recurrences, a scheme is proposed for implementing
                 residue arithmetic based on ROAMs. The efficiency of
                 the scheme is established by comparison to conventional
                 ROM-based table lookup techniques. Applications to
                 residue-to-binary number system conversion are also

                 $ A N $ codes are linear and cannot be used to detect

                 Fermat number transforms (FNT) and other residue number
                 algorithms. There is need for a good multiplication
                 algorithm which can be realized easily on a VLSI chip.
                 In this paper, the Leibowitz multiplier [1] is modified
                 to realize multiplication in the ring of integers
                 modulo a Fermat number. The advantage of this new
                 algorithm over Leibowitz's algorithm is that
                 Leibowitz's algorithm takes modulo after the product of
                 multiplication is obtained. Hence time is wasted. In
                 this new algorithm, modulo is taken in every bit
                 operation when performing multiplication. Therefore no
                 time is wasted in this respect. Furthermore, this
                 algorithm requires only a sequence of cyclic shifts and
                 additions. The design[s] for this new multiplier are
                 regular, simple, expandable and therefore, suitable far

                 to approximate the corresponding operations over the
                 real numbers as close as possible. In this paper it is
                 shown by means of counterexamples that this need not be
                 true for existing machines. For achieving good
                 numerical results a floating-point arithmetic
                 approximating the real operations as close as possible
                 is probably best. For achieving verifications on
                 computers, at least a precisely defined computer
                 arithmetic is indispensable.\par

                 In this paper we first introduce the Kulisch\slash
                 Miranker theory, which represents a sound basis for
                 computer arithmetic. Each operation is precisely
                 defined and, moreover, is of maximum accuracy. That
                 means, the computed result is the floating-point number
                 of the working precision closest to the infinite
                 precise result. The theory also covers directed
                 roundings allowing computations with intervals. These
                 properties hold true for the floating-point numbers of
                 single and double precision as well as for the vectors,
                 matrices and complex extensions over those.\par

                 In the second part of the paper we demonstrate the
                 theoretical basis for what we call 'Higher Order
                 Computer Arithmetic'. This is an inclusion theory
                 allowing the development of algorithms to compute
                 bounds for the solution of various problems in
                 numerical analysis. These bounds are automatically
                 verified to be correct and they are of high accuracy.
                 Very often they are of maximum accuracy, that means the
                 left and right bounds of all components of the solution
                 are adjacent in the floating-point screen. Moreover
                 existence and uniqueness of a solution within the
                 computed bounds is automatically verified by the
                 algorithm. If this verification is not possible, a
                 respective message is given. We develop the theory and
                 give algorithms for the solution of systems of linear
                 and nonlinear equations. As demonstrated by examples
                 even for extremely ill-conditioned problems existence
                 and uniqueness of the solution is verified within
                 bounds of least significant bit accuracy.",

                 processor, with appreciably reduced latency and cost.
                 The inner product processor is implemented with a tree
                 of carry propagate or carry save adders; this tree is
                 obtained with the incorporation of three innovations in
                 the conventional multiply/add tree:\par

                 (1) The leaf-multipliers are expanded into adder
                 subtrees, thus achieving an $ O(\log N b) $ latency,
                 where $N$ denotes the number of elements in a vector
                 and $b$ the number of bits in each element.\par

                 (2) The partial products, to be summed in producing an
                 inner product, are reordered according to their
                 ``minimum alignments'' bringing approximately a 20\%

                 at data rates of up to 40 MHz (complex). The current
                 implementation computes transforms of up to 16,384
                 points in length by means of the radix 4 pipeline FFT
                 algorithm. The interstage reordering is performed by
                 delay commutators implemented with semi-custom VLSI,
                 while the arithmetic is performed by commercial single

                 The cost and performance of each alternative is
                 evaluated in terms a specific ECL gate array
                 technology. We find that we can build a 15\% faster
                 divider with radix four stages than with radix two
                 stages, for about the same amount of hardware. Between
                 the two radix 4 alternatives, method (c) offers more
                 speed than method (b) at the cost of 20\% more
                 hardware.\par

                 A radix 16 divider using method (b) has been built for
                 the S-1 Mark IIB computer under development at Lawrence
                 Livermore Laboratory. This divider consists of eight
                 ECL gate arrays and has a 12.5 nanosecond cycle time.
                 It performs IEEE single and double precision floating
                 point division in 150 and 225 nanoseconds,
                 respectively, the shortest times reported for any

                 One of the main achievements is in allowing the

                 systolic array has been used to implement one of the
                 most representative operations, the modular multiplier.
                 It is shown that a linear systolic array can compute
                 $N$ modular products in time $ O(N) $ with constant

                 digit at a time. This feature of digit on-line
                 arithmetic allows a significant amount of overlapping
                 of arithmetic operations.\par

                 Digit on-line arithmetic can sometimes produce
                 unnormalized results. This can present a problem for
                 the divide and square root algorithms. If the divisor
                 and radicand are highly unnormalized, these algorithms
                 will not produce the correct results. Two advances in
                 overcoming this problem are presented. First, several
                 techniques for producing results that are closer to
                 being normalized are developed. Second, it is shown
                 that normalized results are not necessary for divide
                 and square root to work properly. Combining these
                 results yields algorithms that will always give the

  abstract =     "Since the number of components that can fit on a
                 single chip is large and rapidly growing, the
                 asymptotic analysis and computational complexity have
                 become applicable to the VLSI systems. We propose a
                 model of computation devoted to VLSI structures based
                 on Residue Number System (RNS). The developed model
                 employs the `cut theorem' which has been used by most
                 of the abstract VLSI models. It is not as general as
                 other reported models, but it gives tighter lower
                 bounds and more accurate measures of performance for
                 RNS structures. This computational model relates the
                 area and time complexities with the inherent properties
                 of RNS, the moduli size and the dynamic range. The
                 model supports the look-up table implementation
                 approach and it is technology-independent.",

  abstract =     "In this paper it is shown that, under the assumption
                 of the logarithmic distribution of numbers,
                 floating-point addition and subtraction can result in
                 overflow or underflow with alarming frequency?--a
                 frequency that increases rapidly with machine speed
                 unless the range of the exponent is also increased. If
                 numbers are assumed to be distributed in accordance
                 with Sweeney's (1965) experiments, then severe loss of
                 significance occurs with large probability in floating
                 point subtraction. These results have implications for
                 computer design and lead to the suggestion of a long
                 word format which will reduce the risks to acceptable
                 levels.",

                 University of California at Berkeley for parallel
                 processing research. Its development is part of a
                 long-term effort to study hardware and software issues
                 in multiprocessing, in general, and parallel processing
                 in LISP, in particular. This paper concentrates on the
                 initial architectural research and development of SPUR.
                 A SPUR processor is a general-purpose RISC processor
                 that provides support for Common LISP and IEEE
                 floating-point. A processor is implemented on a single
                 board with about 200 standard chips and three custom
                 two-micron CMOS chips: the cache controller, the CPU,
                 and the floating-point coprocessor. The chip that
                 manages the cache handles cache access by the CPU,
                 performing address translation, accessing shared memory
                 over the SPUR bus, and maintaining cache consistency.

                 which is not too close to values for which $ e^x $
                 would overflow or underflow. (For values of $x$ which
                 are not within this range, an error condition is

                 $p$-digit argument, for any $ p > 0 $ ($p$-digit means
                 $p$-decimal-digit). The program and analysis are valid
                 for all $ p > 0 $, but current implementations place a

                 The routines use floating point operations with

                 computer is surveyed. The methodology for defining and
                 implementing floating-point arithmetic is described.
                 Shortcomings of elementary floating-point arithmetic
                 are revealed through sample problems. The development
                 of automatic computation with emphasis on the user
                 control of errors is reviewed. The limitations of
                 conventional rule-of-thumb procedures for error control
                 in scientific computation are demonstrated by means of
                 examples. Computer arithmetic is extended so that the
                 arithmetic operations in the linear spaces and their
                 interval correspondents which are most commonly used in
                 computation can be performed with maximum accuracy on
                 digital computers. A new fundamental computer
                 operation, the scalar product, is introduced to develop
                 this advanced computer arithmetic.",
