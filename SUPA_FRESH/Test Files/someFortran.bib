  note-2 =       "The article begins: ``The FORTRAN project was begun in
                 the summer of 1954. Its purpose was to reduce by a
                 large factor the task of preparing scientific problems
                 for IBM's next large computer, the 704. If it were
                 possible for the 704 to code problems for itself and
                 produce as good programs as human codes (but without
                 the errors), it was clear that large benefits could be
                 achieved. For it was known that about two-thirds of the
                 cost of solving most scientific and engineering
                 problems on large computers was that of problem
                 preparation. Furthermore, more than 90 percent of the
                 elapsed time for a problem was usually devoted to
                 planning, writing, and debugging the program. In many
                 cases the development of a general plan for solving a
                 problem was a small job in comparison to the task of
                 devising and coding machine procedures to carry out the
                 plan. The goal of the FORTRAN project was to enable the
                 programmer to specify a numerical procedure using a
                 concise language like that of mathematics and obtain
                 automatically from this specification an efficient 704
                 program to carry out the procedure. It was expected
                 that such a system would reduce the coding and
                 debugging task to less than one-fifth of the job it had
                 been.\par

                 Two and one-half years and 18 man years have elapsed
                 since the beginning of the project. The FORTRAN system
                 is now complete. It has two components: the FORTRAN
                 language, in which programs are written, and the
                 translator or executive routine for the 704 which
                 effects the translation of FORTRAN language programs
                 into 704 programs. Descriptions of the FORTRAN language
                 and the translator form the principal sections of this
                 paper.''",
  note-3 =       "The IBM 704 had 86 instructions, a 36-bit word,
                 signed-magnitude number representation, and a 15-bit
                 word-addressed memory space (32768 words, or 191K 6-bit
                 characters). Floating-point was {\em standard}, not
                 optional. 4K-, 8K- and 32K-word systems were sold, but
                 memory was treated cyclically, so programs compiled for
                 one memory size could not run on a system with a
                 different memory capacity. The machine was announced in
                 1954, and delivered in late 1955. From 1955 to 1960,
                 123 machines were delivered. [From Gerrit A. Blaauw and

  abstract =     "The IR**n programming environment is an integrated
                 collection of tools to assist programmers in building
                 numerical software in Fortran. One of the primary goals
                 of the IR**n programming environment project is to
                 mount a concerted attack on the problems of performing
                 interprocedural analysis and optimization in a
                 compiler. The existence of a software development
                 environment like the IR**n programming environment
                 changes the compilation process enough to make
                 computing such information palatable. Since all modules
                 are developed and all programs are defined using tools
                 of the environment, these tools can cooperate to record
                 the information necessary to do a good job of
                 interprocedural analysis and optimization. Whenever the
                 compiler needs information about possible side effects
                 of a particular procedure, it can simply extract this
                 information from the environment's central database.
                 Because the only mechanism for changing modules or
                 programs is through the tools provided by the
                 environment, the compiler is assured that it will be
                 notified of any changes. Thus, it can use information
                 derived from previous analysis with certain knowledge
                 that the information reflects the current state of the
                 program and its procedures. This paper examines the
                 effect of performing interprocedural analysis and
                 optimization on each of the major components of the
                 environment. It should become clear from the discussion
                 that the decision to employ interprocedural techniques
                 had profoundly influenced almost every aspect of the
                 design of the IR**n environment.",

                 which all subroutine calls are expanded inline.
                 However, the techniques presented here can easily be

  abstract =     "Fourth-Generation Languages or 4GL's are a special
                 breed of languages. The principal reason for the
                 success of 4GL's lies in the fact that they are used to
                 solve a restricted set of problems. In this context it
                 should be noted that 4GL's, like COBOL, but unlike
                 Pascal and Fortran are `file' or `database' languages.
                 This restricts both COBOL problems and 4GL problems to
                 file handling problems. The principal gain of using a
                 4GL lies in the necessary simplification of the problem
                 definition. We will describe four typical mechanisms
                 for simplification: (i) change of input specifications,
                 (ii) change of output specifications, and (iii) neglect
                 of computing efficiency.",

                 teaching and for use on microprocessors, it has not
                 been very successful for scientific calculations. Apart
                 from the pre-eminence of FORTRAN in this application
                 area, several technical defects in Pascal have
                 inhibited its use. One defect has been the problem in
                 Pascal as defined by Jensen and Wirth of the inability
                 to handle arrays of varying size as parameters to
                 procedures. The level 1 option in ISO-Pascal addressed
                 this defect by means of conformant arrays, albeit in a
                 somewhat inelegant fashion. Array handling in
                 ISO-Pascal can now be regarded as adequate since level
                 1 validated compilers are available for the majority of
                 widely available machines. This note addresses another
                 defect of Pascal, that no facility is provided to
                 handle floating point types of more than one
                 precision.",

                 control-, data-, or demand-driven models of execution.
                 A PDW combines a single-assignment version of the
                 program with explicit operators that manage the flow of
                 data values. The PDW can be viewed as an augmented
                 Program Dependence Graph. Translation to the PDW
                 representation provides the basis for projects to
                 compile Fortran onto dynamic dataflow architectures and
                 simulators. A second application of the PDW is the
                 construction of various compositional semantics for

                 transformation, called scalar replacement, that finds
                 opportunities for reuse of subscripted variables and
                 replaces the references involved by references to
                 temporary scalar variables. The objective is to
                 increase the likelihood that these elements will be
                 assigned to registers by the coloring-based register
                 allocators found in most compilers. In addition, we
                 present transformations to improve the overall
                 effectiveness of scalar replacement and show how these
                 transformations can be applied in a variety of loop
                 nest types. Finally, we present experimental results
                 showing that these techniques are extremely effective
                 --- capable of achieving integer factor speedups over
                 code generated by good optimizing compilers of
                 conventional design.",

                 Abstract: ``QDMC is a set of Fortran programs for
                 constrained Quadratic Dynamic Matrix Control Simulation
                 and property study of the QDMC `equivalent' feedback
                 linear controllers. Based on the time invariant impulse
                 response model and plant, the simulation program
                 minimizes a quadratic objective function subject to
                 hard constraints on manipulated variables and/or on
                 controlled variables. On-line stability conditions are
                 also calculated in this program. There are five
                 programs created for studying the properties of the
                 controller. Program CJI creates QDMC `equivalent'
                 feedback linear controllers as frequency files which
                 depend on the active constraints situation. Program
                 CJINOM is for nominal stability test of these
                 controllers. Program CJISEP is used to separate them
                 into tuning parameter dependent and independent sets.
                 Program PREL is for testing the practical relevance of
                 a set of QDMC active constraints. Program ALLPREL finds
                 all such practically relevant sets.'' Supported by the

  abstract =     "A pseudo-random number generator, based on a
                 linear-feedback shift-register sequence, is presented.
                 The very long period of the generator, $ 2^{1279} - 1
                 $, makes it useful in modern statistical simulations
                 where the shorter period of other generators could
                 either be exhausted during a single run or determine
                 departures from uniform randomness when generating
                 positions in a multidimensional space. In particular,
                 the proposed generator overcomes the limitations of
                 multiplicative-congruential generators with modulus $
                 2^{31} - 1 $, which are widely used on computers with a
                 32-bit integer word size, such as the IBM S/370 family
                 of computers. In this paper the properties of
                 linear-feedback shift-register sequences are shortly
                 reviewed and a sequence of order $ p = 1279 $ is
                 proposed as a source of pseudorandom numbers. The
                 production rule, by itself recursive, is efficiently
                 vectorized on existing pipelined vector processors, due
                 to the large distance between the feedback positions
                 and the positions to be generated. The algorithm may be
                 implemented in FORTRAN and may be easily ported on
                 computers with different word-lengths. Using a
                 vectorized FORTRAN implementation of the algorithm on
                 the IBM 3090 model E Vector Facility, a rate of about
                 6.5 million normalized random numbers per second
                 (Mrands) is achieved. A rate of about 3 Mrands is
                 obtained by an implementation of the algorithm on the
                 IBM RISC/6000 model 530. Simple statistical tests have
                 shown the superiority of the proposed generator with
                 respect to the widely used multiplicative-congruential
                 generator with modulus $ M = 2^{31} - 1 $ and
                 multiplier $ A = 75 $.",

                 of FORTRAN 77 subprograms for carrying out matrix
                 multiplications and the solution of triangular systems
                 with multiple right-hand sides. They are intended to
                 provide efficient and portable building blocks for
                 linear algebra algorithms on high-performance
                 computers. We describe algorithms for the BLAS3
                 operations that are asymptotically faster than the
                 conventional ones. These algorithms are based on
                 Strassen's method for fast matrix multiplication, which
                 is now recognized to be a practically useful technique
                 once matrix dimensions exceed about 100. We pay
                 particular attention to the numerical stability of
                 these ``fast BLAS3.'' Error bounds are given and their
                 significance is explained and illustrated with the aid
                 of numerical experiments. Our conclusion is that the
                 fast BLAS3, although not as strongly stable as
                 conventional implementations, are stable enough to
                 merit careful consideration in many applications.",

  abstract =     "This paper describes the SPLASH systolic array and the
                 implementation of a cornerturn algorithm on that array.
                 For this application a cornerturn is defined as the
                 transpose of a bit matrix. In effect a matrix is
                 cornerturned by flipping it about its' [sic] major
                 axis. This cornerturn system transposes one or a stream
                 of n x m (where n,m [less than or equal to] 32)
                 matrices using the SPLASH hardware in a Sun
                 workstation. This cornerturn system consists of a Sun
                 workstation; SPLASH hardware (two cards) in the Sun
                 workstation; software that defines the cornerturn
                 configuration in SPLASH; and a driver written in C that
                 interfaces between the user and SPLASH. The system
                 performs 100 times faster than FORTRAN executing in a
                 Sun3 when the user sends a large array of 32 x 32 bit
                 matrices to be cornerturned. The system performs at 50
                 times faster than FORTRAN when given a small number of
                 matrices of degree less than 32 x 32.",

                 Monte Carlo calculations. The conclusion is that
                 pseudorandom number generators with the required
                 properties are now available, but the generators
                 actually used are often not good enough. Portable
                 Fortran code is given for three different pseudorandom
                 number generators, all of which have much better
                 properties than any of the traditional generators
                 commonly supplied in most program libraries.",

                 of a Hybrid Monte Carlo algorithm which incorporates
                 dynamical quarks exactly. The large computational needs
                 of the program necessitate to use modern supercomputers
                 like the CRAY Y-MP that achieve their high computing
                 speed by using both vector and parallel hardware. This
                 paper gives a short introduction into the CRAY Y-MP
                 system architecture and the autotasking concept which
                 offers a way for finding automatically parallelism in
                 existing FORTRAN programs. In detail, the paper
                 describes the application as well as the optimization
                 and transformation process which had to be done to
                 improve the performance. After some code modifications
                 a speedup of nearly 7 on a CRAY Y-MP8\slash 832 could
                 be achieved, leading to a performance of about 1.65

  abstract =     "Discusses the automation of the process of numerical
                 solving of partial differential equations systems
                 (PDES) by means of computer algebra. For solving PDES
                 the finite difference method is applied. The computer
                 algebra system REDUCE and the numerical programming
                 language FORTRAN are used in the methodology presented,
                 its main aim being to speed up the process of preparing
                 numerical programs for solving PDES. Quite often,
                 especially for complicated systems, this process is a
                 tedious and time consuming task. In the process several
                 stages can be found in which computer algebra can be
                 used for performing routine analytical calculations,
                 namely: transformation of differential equations into
                 different coordinate systems, discretization of
                 differential equations, analysis of difference schemes,
                 and generation of numerical programs. The FIDE package
                 is applied to two physical problems. The first one is
                 the nonlinear Schr{\"o}dinger equation. The second one
                 is the Fokker--Planck equation. The numerical programs
                 have been tested and compared with similar published
                 calculations.",

                 using the Starbase routines can be in C, Fortran, Lisp,
                 or Pascal. The programs you write in Starbase are
                 device independent. In other words, you can run a
                 single program on a number of different output devices
                 without changing the logic of your program. Starbase
                 supports all devices which are supported by HP-UX. This
                 document designed to help students those who are taking
                 {\em introduction to computer graphics} class. If you
                 are already familiar with Starbase, you may use {\em
                 Starbase Device Drivers Library Manual or Starbase

                 primitive control and data structures antithetic to
                 structured programming. It is not an extensible
                 language, hence is limited to rather mundane number
                 crunching tasks. Nonetheless, FORTRAN remains popular
                 with scientists and engineers because it permits
                 painless mixed-type arithmetic including complex
                 numbers. Because Forth style is so different from
                 FORTRAN's many computer uses who should naturally be
                 attracted to Forth have avoided it, even to the extend
                 of choosing Pascal or (ugh!) C for non-number-crunching
                 tasks. This paper discusses the problems associated
                 with developing a partial FORTRAN \(\rightarrow\) Forth
                 translator designed to entice FORTRAN programmers into
                 the Forth universe. A working program will be made
                 available for testing.",

                 VectorFORTH was developed to extend Forth programming
                 techniques to array processing. The implementation of
                 vectorFORTH emphasizes maximum processing speed while
                 remaining essentially transparent to the user. FORTH,
                 Inc. also developed an array processing simulator

                 been developed. The programming environment comprises a
                 context-sensitive hybrid editor, an interactive
                 interpreter and a literate programming system. The
                 editor can be used as a text editor as well as a
                 structure editor; both modes may be mixed freely. It
                 guarantees immediate recognition of syntactic and
                 semantic errors, but does not insist on immediate error
                 correction. The interpreter can be used to execute and
                 debug incomplete program fragments. The literate
                 programming system offers documentation support in the
                 style of WEB. The authors describe the main features of
                 the tools and demonstrate how they support the
                 construction and documentation of programs written in
                 extended FORTRAN8x, the programming language for the
                 massively parallel Suprenum machine.",

  abstract =     "This paper reports the results of a study of the
                 relationship between computer programming skills and
                 problem-solving abilities. Students in two introductory
                 programming courses (FORTRAN and PASCAL) of a large
                 university served as the subjects for this study.
                 Students' problem-solving abilities were assessed
                 during the first month that each computer programming
                 course commenced and again during the final month of
                 the course. Analysis of pretest and posttest results
                 indicated that students who had successfully completed
                 all computer programming course requirements
                 experienced significant improvement in their overall
                 problem skills. Results also suggested that students
                 who had successfully completed computer programming
                 course requirements experienced significant improvement
                 on the logical reasoning section of the problem-solving
                 assessment.",

                 the codon usage of a gene departs from equal usage of
                 synonymous codons. This measure of synonymous codon
                 usage bias, the `effective number of codons used in a
                 gene', Nc, can be easily calculated from codon usage
                 data alone, and is independent of gene length and amino
                 acid (aa) composition. Nc can take values from 20, in
                 the case of extreme bias where one codon is exclusively
                 used for each aa, to 61 when the use of alternative
                 synonymous codons is equally likely. Nc thus provides
                 an intuitively meaningful measure of the extent of
                 codon preference in a gene. Codon usage patterns across
                 genes can be investigated by the Nc-plot: a plot of Nc

                 procedure or function. However, along with
                 encapsulating ``algorithms'', ``data types'', and
                 ``parameters'', it also encapsulates ``parallel
                 constructs'' such as the above distinctions. Apparently
                 the authors felt that the (non-strict) dataflow
                 paradigm is the most flexible (able to be translated
                 into any of the other paradigms), so the highest level
                 ``moleculized'' program is specified using this form.
                 By ``non-strict dataflow'', they mean the single
                 assignment rule for {\em atomic\/} objects; ie: if
                 ``i'' is an integer, it can be assigned a value only
                 once, but if ``a'' is an array of integers, each
                 element can {\em individually\/} be assigned a value,
                 but only once. No lazy evaluation specified. \ldots{}
                 Long analysis removed. Some other discussion questions:
                 They show a diagram (Fig 2, page 594) demonstrating how
                 the ``dataflow'' specification can be translated into

                 Park and Harvard University appear on cover. Includes
                 bibliographical references. Abstract: ``FSQP 2.0 is a
                 set of Fortran subroutines for the minimization of the
                 maximum of a set of smooth objective functions
                 (possibly a single one) subject to nonlinear smooth
                 inequality constraints, linear inequality and linear
                 equality constraints, and simple bounds on the
                 variables. If the initial guess provided by the user is
                 infeasible, FSQP first generates a feasible point;
                 subsequently the successive iterates generated by FSQP
                 all satisfy the constraints. The user has the option of
                 requiring that the maximum value among the objective
                 functions decrease at each iteration after feasibility
                 has been reached (monotone line search). He/She must
                 provide subroutines that define the objective functions
                 and constraint functions and may either provide
                 subroutines to compute the gradients of these functions
                 or require that FSQP estimate them by forward finite
                 differences. FSQP 2.0 implements two algorithms based
                 on Sequential Quadratic Programming (SQP), modified so
                 as to generate feasible iterates. In the first one
                 (monotone line search), a certain Armijo type arc
                 search is used with the property that the step of one
                 is eventually accepted, a requirement for superlinear
                 convergence. In the second one the same effect is
                 achieved by means of a (nonmonotone) search along a
                 straight line. The merit function used in both searches
                 is the maximum of the objectives functions.'' Supported

                 support that allows a Fortran user to achieve sustained
                 floating-point performance of over 10 gigaflops on the

                 substantially over the previous record of 5.6
                 gigaflops, which was achieved by means of hand-crafted
                 low-level coding techniques. The compiler module
                 processes array assignment statements of a certain
                 form: the right-hand side must be a sum of products and
                 the products must use the Fortran 90 array shifting
                 intrinsics in a certain stylized pattern. Such
                 assignment statements are suitable for expressing array
                 convolution (stencil) computations and can be executed
                 efficiently by chained multiply-add operations.",

  abstract =     "This article intended to help readers compare the
                 three products, SENAC, InterCall and IRENA. Each of the
                 three is in the Numerical Algorithms Group (Fortran
                 77). SENAC is a package developed by the Mathematical
                 Software Project at the University of Waikato. SENAC
                 includes a symbolic manipulation interpreter (Sencore),
                 together with high level interfaces to the NAG Fortran
                 Library (Numlink) and NAG Graphics Library (Graflink).
                 The system evolved from an interface, Naglink, between
                 the NAG Library and the symbolic manipulation language
                 Macsyma. The Sensore interpreter is written in Common
                 LISP and belongs to the Macsyma/Maple/Reduce family of
                 languages. It is easy to load user-written files
                 written in Common LISP or in SENAC. InterCall is a
                 Mathematica package that enables its user to
                 interactively call external code, for example from an
                 external numeric library. It allows various default
                 settings to be defined for any arguments that need to
                 be passed to any routine in that code, and initial
                 default settings for all the routines in the IMSL and
                 NAG libraries are included with InterCall in the form
                 of a small defaults-database file. IRENA-an Interface
                 from Reduce to NAG-runs under the Reduce computer
                 algebra system and provides an interactive front end to
                 the NAG Library. It has been designed to make the use
                 of the NAG Library considerably simpler, in a number of
                 ways.",

                 performance of the fast Fourier transform algorithm on
                 modern vector oriented supercomputers is presented. FFT
                 implementations based on these techniques are developed
                 for the CRAY-2 and the CRAY-YMP, and it is shown that
                 they achieve higher performance than previously
                 measured on these machines. The techniques include (1)
                 using gather/scatter operations to maintain optimum
                 length vectors throughout all stages of small to medium
                 sized FFTs, (2) efficient radix-8 and radix-16 inner
                 loops, which allow vector loads/stores to be overlapped
                 as much as possible and also reduce the arithmetic
                 operation count, and (3) prefetching twiddle factors as
                 vectors, so that on the CRAY-2 they can later be
                 fetched from local memory in parallel with common
                 memory accesses. Performance results for FORTRAN
                 implementations embodying these techniques demonstrate
                 that they are faster than CRAY's library FFT routine.
                 The actual speedups obtained are dependent on the size
                 of the FFT being computed and the supercomputer being
                 used and range from about 5 to over 300 percent.",

                 the goal of providing efficient, but portable,
                 implementations of algorithms for high performance
                 computers. The model implementation provides a portable
                 set of FORTRAN 77 Sparse BLAS for the use on machines
                 where specially tuned implementations do not exist or
                 are not required. The test software is designed to
                 verify that tuned implementations meet the
                 specifications of the Sparse BLAS and that
                 implementations are correctly installed.",

                 presents Fortran D, a version of Fortran enhanced with
                 data decomposition specifications. It is designed to
                 support two fundamental stages of writing a
                 data-parallel program: problem mapping using
                 sophisticated array alignments, and machine mapping
                 through a rich set of data distribution functions. We
                 believe that Fortran D provides a simple
                 machine-independent programming model for most
                 numerical computations. We intend to evaluate its
                 usefulness for both programmers and advanced compilers
                 on a variety of parallel architectures.'' Supported in

  abstract =     "One of the fundamental problems encountered when
                 debugging a parallel program is determining the
                 possible orders in which events could have occurred.
                 Various problems, such as data races and intermittent
                 deadlock, arise when there is insufficient
                 synchronization between the tasks in a parallel
                 program. A sequential trace of an execution can be
                 misleading, as it implies additional event orderings,
                 distorting the concurrent nature of the computation.
                 This paper describes algorithms which generate those
                 event orderings which can be relied on by the
                 programmer from the trace of an execution. By its very
                 nature, the information in an execution trace pertains
                 only to that execution of the program, and may not
                 generalize to other executions. We tackle this
                 difficulty in a systematic way: defining an ``inferred
                 program'' based on the trace and original program,
                 analyze this inferred program, and prove a relationship
                 between the inferred program and the original. The
                 results of our algorithms can be used by other
                 automated tools such as a data race detector or
                 constraint checker. The basic algorithms described here
                 have been implemented in a working trace analyzer for
                 IBM Parallel Fortran. The trace analyzer graphically
                 presents the discovered event orderings and reports
                 various potential data races in the subject program.",

  abstract =     "The IPS-2 parallel program measurement tools provide
                 performance data from application programs, the
                 operating system, hardware, network, and other sources.
                 Previous versions of IPS-2 allowed programmers to
                 collect information about an application based only on
                 what could be collected by software instrumentation
                 inserted into the program (and system call libraries).
                 We have developed an open interface, called the
                 ``external time histogram'', providing a graceful way
                 to include external data from many sources. The user
                 can tell IPS-2 of new sources of performance data
                 through an extensible metric description language. The
                 data from these external sources is automatically
                 collected when the application program is run. IPS-2
                 provides a library to simplify constructing the
                 external data collectors. The new version of IPS-2 can
                 measure shared-memory and message-passing parallel
                 programs running on a heterogeneous collection of
                 machines. Data from C or Fortran programs, and data
                 from simulations can be processed by the same tool. As
                 a result of including the new external performance
                 data, IPS-2 now can report on a whole new set of
                 performance problems. We describe the results of using
                 IPS-2 on two real applications: a shared-memory
                 database join utility, and a multi-processor
                 interconnection network simulator. Even though these
                 applications previously went through careful tuning, we
                 were able to precisely identify performance problems
                 and extract additional performance improvements of
                 about 30\%.",

  abstract =     "Weiser has built slicers for FORTRAN and an abstract
                 data type language called Simple\_D. His slicers were
                 based on a flow-graph representation of programs. In
                 addition, Weiser's method for slicing across procedure
                 calls does not produce as precise a slice as possible;
                 Weiser's algorithm lacks a mechanism to keep track of
                 the calling context of a called procedure. Methods for
                 more precise intraprocedural slicing have been
                 developed by Horwitz et al. Horwitz describes a special
                 form of a program dependency graph called a system
                 dependency graph (SDG) that can be used for slicing.
                 This SDG models a language consisting of a single
                 (main) program and a collection of procedures.
                 Parameters are passed by value-result. This simple
                 language supports scalar variables, assignment
                 statements, conditional statements, and while loops. We
                 have designed and implemented algorithms which take as
                 input a source program written in a subset of ANSI C
                 and produce an internal representation (IR) that is
                 based on the (SDG) approach defined above and which can
                 subsequently be used by any of our three implemented
                 tools: slicer, dicer, or ripple analyzer. These tools
                 have been integrated into the C-Ghinsu environment. We
                 present in this paper the theoretical background and
                 necessary functional details of this tool.",

  abstract =     "An algorithm is described for solving large-scale
                 instances of the Symmetric Traveling Salesman Problem
                 (STSP) to optimality. The core of the algorithm is a
                 `polyhedral' cutting-plane procedure that exploits a
                 subset of the system of linear inequalities defining
                 the convex hull of the incidence vectors of the
                 Hamiltonian cycles of a complete graph. The cuts are
                 generated by several identification procedures that
                 have been described in a companion paper. Whenever the
                 cutting-plane procedure does not terminate with an
                 optimal solution the algorithm uses a tree-search
                 strategy that, as opposed to branch-and-bound, keeps on
                 producing cuts after branching. The algorithm has been
                 implemented in FORTRAN. Two different linear
                 programming (LP) packages have been used as the LP
                 solver. The implementation of the algorithm and the
                 interface with one of the LP solvers is described in
                 sufficient detail to permit the replication of our
                 experiments. Computational results are reported with up
                 to 42 STSPs with sizes ranging from 48 to 2,392 nodes.
                 Most of the medium-sized test problems are taken from
                 the literature; all others are large-scale real-world
                 problems. All of the instances considered in this study
                 were solved to optimality by the algorithm in
                 `reasonable' computation times.",

                 Fortran programs. Our approach is based on the use of a
                 polymorphic functional language, CAML. In this paper,
                 we explain the advantages of this choice and the
                 construction of the first components of what will be a
                 toolkit for program analysis and transformation. Two
                 examples of applications are presented.''.",

  abstract =     "This document describes techniques that can be used to
                 tune the performance of CM Fortran programs compiled
                 for the slicewise execution model. The slicewise model,
                 first available with CM Fortran Version 1.0, uses the
                 units of the 64-bit floating-point accelerator as the
                 basic physical processing elements. By treating the CM
                 as a set of vector processors, and by using the
                 floating-point registers to avoid many read/writes to
                 memory, the slicewise model excels at performing
                 elemental operations on floating-point and integer
                 data. This paper uses numerous examples to demonstrate
                 source-code restructuring that optimizes performance
                 under the slicewise model. These transformations help
                 the compiler isolate elemental computation and avoid
                 read/writes to memory. Also, since arrays in the
                 slicewise model are mapped to CM memory differently
                 from the alternative (`fieldwise') model, this paper
                 provides optimization hints that pertain to array size,
                 shape, and layout. Finally, the paper describes methods
                 for calculating/predicting the peak speed of elemental
                 CM Fortran kernels.",

                 IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center to automatically
                 restructure sequential Fortran programs for execution
                 on parallel architectures. This chapter describes the
                 PTRAN system, and its implementation as of the end of
                 1989. The primary functions of PTRAN are analysis and
                 process formation. The goal of PTRAN's analyzer is to
                 understand the program's control and data dependence
                 patterns as completely as possible. The goal of PTRAN's
                 process former is to generate a parallel program that
                 satisfies all dependences while optimally trading off
                 parallelism with overhead in the target multiprocessor.
                 This chapter on PTRAN serves as a contrast to the other
                 chapters on parallel functional programming. The input
                 programming language for the PTRAN system is Fortran
                 --- the antithesis of the functional languages proposed
                 in this book! However, the goal of compiler analysis
                 for automatic parallelization is to derive the same
                 level of abstraction from a Fortran program as is found
                 in functional languages.",

  abstract =     "Two IBM Enterprise System/3090 Model 600J computer
                 systems, each with six processors capable of executing
                 vector and scalar instructions, have been connected
                 into a cluster for parallel execution of single FORTRAN
                 programs. The clustering is achieved through a
                 combination of software and hardware. When enabled for
                 parallel execution and allowed to use all twelve
                 processors in the cluster, FORTRAN programs have run as
                 much as 11.7 times faster than when run on a single
                 processor. The combined hardware and software
                 technology is called IBM Clustered FORTRAN. It was
                 achieved by modifying existing technology quickly to
                 provide new capabilities. The paper discusses the
                 modifications and the motivations behind them. It
                 summarizes the performance of several applications
                 executed with Clustered FORTRAN. Finally, it describes
                 how clustering has been used to improve performance in
                 novel ways.",

                 obtained if the protein is found to contain a

                 337 known motifs encoded as a list of allowed residue
                 types at specific positions along the sequence. PROMOT
                 is a FORTRAN computer program that takes a protein
                 sequence and examines if it contains any of the motifs
                 in PROSITE. The program also extends the definitions of
                 patterns beyond those used in PROSITE to provide a
                 simple, yet flexible, method to scan either a PROSITE
                 or a user-defined pattern against a protein sequence

                 use in a wide range of fields. The wavelet transform,
                 in particular, has generated considerable interest
                 because it can have several useful properties including
                 logarithmic spectral division, orthogonality,
                 implementation with finite-length filters, and real
                 transform values from real data. In this thesis, we
                 offer an introduction to multiresolution and wavelet
                 analysis, then examine the implementation of the
                 discrete wavelet transform on several computing
                 platforms. The discussion encompasses sequential,
                 vector, MIMD, SIMD, and VLSI architectures, and we
                 develop FORTRAN programs for the Cray X-MP, Alliant
                 FX-80, and Connection Machine supercomputers. Our
                 results demonstrate the considerable advantage in
                 exploiting the parallelism and data-locality inherent
                 in the transform.",

                 Y-MP, using as benchmarks long-running scientific
                 applications from the PERFECT Club benchmark set, is
                 reported. Since the compiler plays a major role in
                 determining machine utilization and program execution
                 speed, the authors compile their benchmarks using the
                 state-of-the-art Cray Research production Fortran
                 compiler. They investigate instruction set usage,
                 operation execution counts, sizes of basic blocks in
                 the programs, and instruction issue rate. The
                 vectorized fraction of the dynamic program operation
                 count ranges from 4\% to 96\% for the benchmarks.
                 Instructions that move values between the scalar
                 registers and corresponding backup registers form a
                 significant fraction of the dynamic instruction count.
                 Basic blocks which are more than 100 instructions in
                 size are significant in number; both small and large
                 basic blocks are important from the point of view of
                 program performance. The instruction issue rate is less
                 than 0.5 instructions per clock cycle for each of the
                 benchmark programs, suggesting that the instruction
                 issue stage of the CRAY Y-MP is, on the average, not a
                 bottleneck.",
